0,"Domestic workers staged a dharna in front of the AG’s Office here on Thursday demanding a comprehensive law for better working conditions, compensation to domestic workers who have lost jobs, and implementation of the urban employment scheme.
The protest organised under the umbrella of the SEWA-Union was part of a national agitation against the changes brought by the Union government to labour laws.
Inaugurating the protest, Sonia George, general secretary of the SEWA-Union, said the dharna was the first of protests by domestic workers.
In a statement here, the SEWA-Union said domestic workers were among the section of workers who had lost their jobs the most. Though they provided an essential service, they were being kept away from the workplace on the grounds of being virus carriers. The labour bills passed by Parliament did not cover domestic workers.
Ms. George said the Code on Social Security did not define private homes as an establishment or define an employer. Till then, workspaces of domestic workers would not get any recognition and they would not be able to highlight any violation of labour rights in that space.
There were apprehensions that the domestic workers would not get any entitlements if they could not prove they were a worker, though the Union government’s argument was that they were universalising social security benefits, she said."

3,"Sabbani Janakiramulu, an oustee of Mamidyala village in Mulugu mandal attempted suicide by dousing himself with kerosene before the Revenue Divisional Office (RDO) at Gajwel on Thursday.
Mr. Janakiramulu alleged that for the past few years he has been denied Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) benefits and repeated appeals to officials failed to yield results.
Mr. Janakiramulu came to RDO office with kerosene bottle. However, those present at the spot threw away the kerosene bottle and informed the police. Police immediately shifted him to a station, where they registered a case and are investigating.
According to sources, S. Narasmihulu, S. Janakiramulu and Harikrishna are brothers and had a house spread on 350 yards and three acres of land. The land and house were acquired by the government for Kodapochammasagar reservoir and they were given compensation. However, they were not offered R&R package.
“We gave away our land and house for the construction of Kondapochamma reservoir. In the first list, houses were allotted to about 400 plus oustees of the village. In the second list, names of as many as 181 persons were identified but allotment was made to only 137 persons, while the remaining are still waiting. Our names are in second list which means we are eligible for houses. But, despite moving around Revenue offices, we are not being allotted houses and officials are not responding properly. Myself and my brother Harikirshna have migrated to Kukatpally about a decade back to make a living. But those who migrated well before us from the village got the R&R package and why cannot we is our question,” Mr. Janakiramulu told The Hindu.
“Janakiramulu is not eligible for R&R package as he is not staying in the village for the past one-and-a-half decade. The other compensations were already paid to him. A case was registered against him for creating nuisance at Gajwel police station,” said RDO D. Vijayender Reddy.

4,"The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case against a senior bank official and two others, including a functionary of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, in connection with the seizure of ₹11.48 crore by the Income Tax Department in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Vellore.
Searches were conducted on the premises of the trio and investigators seized certain documents relating to the case, sources in the agency said on Thursday.
A couple of days ago, the CBI’s Anti-Corruption Branch registered a case against Dayanidhi, the then senior manager, Canara Bank, Vellore, DMK functionary ‘Poonjolai’ Srinivasan, his brother Damodaran and others in connection with the seizure of several wads of newly- printed currency of ₹200 denomination. The case was registered under Section 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 477(A) (falsification of accounts) and other provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
The agency said reliable information had been received that the Income Tax Department conducted searches on the premises of Mr. Damodaran in Vellore on April 1, 2019, and seized ₹11.48 crore. During the course of investigation, Mr. Srinivasan claimed that the money belonged to him and was meant for distribution to voters in the Vellore Parliamentary constituency ahead of the election. Based on the seizure, the election was cancelled in the Vellore Lok Sabha constituency and a case was registered against D. Kathir Anand (the candidate and son of senior DMK leader Duraimurugan) under the provisions of the IPC and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, relating to distribution of cash to voters.
The CBI said in the First Information Report that the cash in ₹200 denomination was obtained from the currency chest of Canara Bank, Vellore, by exchanging notes of other denominations. Mr. Dayanidhi had allegedly colluded with the accused persons by abusing his official position and hence committed the offence of criminal misconduct.
“The currency was obtained for facilitating easy distribution of currency notes to the voters in the Vellore Parliamentary constituency during the Parliament election which was to be held on 18.04.2019,” the agency said and added that the activity promoted corruption.
In a formal note to the CBI, the bank authorities confirmed that the senior manager had exchanged the currency notes in the chest without following due procedures. The searches come a couple of days after Mr. Anand, who later contested and won the election, complained that two persons posing as police officials barged into his room at Tamil Nadu House, New Delhi, and questioned him on the issues that the party was planning to raise in Parliament.
Parrying questions on the nature of seizures made on the premises of the trio on Thursday, a CBI official said the agency would summon them soon for questioning. The investigator refused to comment on the role of the MP in the case and also whether he would be questioned."
5,"A 22-year-old youngster from Gundala village in Ranga Reddy district, on Thursday admitted to killing his father 50-days ago and later buried his body in their agriculture field. His mother Lalitha allegedly helped him.
Shamshabad Deputy Commissioner of Police N Prakash Reddy said that the offence took place on the night of July 30 over petty disputes. The accused, Rakesh, told police that his father S. Kistaiah alias Krishna, a farmer, was physically abusing Lalitha, and him after consuming liquor.
On the fateful night too, Kistaiah picked up a heated argument with them, following which the mother-son duo throttled him to death, police said.
“While Rakesh was throttling, Lalitha held Kistaiah's legs. After 10 p.m., they took the body to their field on a bike, about two kilometres from the house, where they dug a pit and buried it,” Mr. Reddy said.
When relatives and family members enquired about the victim's sudden disappearance, the accused told them that Kistaiah was working in Hyderabad as a daily wager owing to financial problems.
""Even after 50-day when he did not return, their relatives grew suspicious and confronted Rakesh, who later confessed of killing his father with the help of his mother,"" the DCP said.
He said that a case was registered and the victim's body will be exhumed on Friday morning. Later, the remnants of the body will be sent to the government hospital for autopsy."
6,"TDP Polit Bureau member and Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has demanded that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy spell out the outcome of his visit to Delhi.
“Mr. Jagan has made many visits to Delhi since he assumed office, and it is his bounden duty to tell people about the new projects he brought for the State,” Mr. Ramakrishnudu said in a statement on Thursday.
Mr. Ramakrishnudu sought to know why the Chief Minister was maintaining silence on all major issues, including his visits to Delhi.
Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s meetings with the Union Ministers were solely aimed at saving his skin and coming clean out of the cases filed against him. All his visits to Delhi and deeds were at the cost of larger interests of the people, he said, adding, “It has become a routine for the CM to commit atrocities in the State and go to Delhi to get reprimanded for his omissions.”
Accusing the YSRCP of perpetrating a “loot and hoard” regime on the people of the State, Mr. Ramakrishnudu deplored that the Chief Minister had not been acting in a desired fashion with regard to promises made in the Reorganisation Act.
Though the Amaravati capital issue was pending before the court, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his MPs were repeatedly raising the issue with the Central government, he said.
Mr. Ramakrishnudu expressed surprise that the State government had stopped all development works and projects, but was asking the Centre for funds.
“Mr. Jagan has no minimum understanding that Central funds will be released only if the government shows some progress on the projects. There will be no support if the State goes on misusing the funds in every way possible,” he said."
7,"A person accused of child sexual abuse escaped recently from the first-line treatment centre (FLTC) being run at the convention centre of the Kochi airport, throwing light on the challenge being faced by the police in guarding those who have tested positive for SARS-COV-2.
The infected among those arrested by the police and excise are put up at the FLTC at Kochi airport along with other infected members of the public. Though police personnel are put on guard duty at the centre, the security remains far from foolproof.
“We have taken up the matter with the District Disaster Management Authority, that it is really tough to keep a tab on the accused who mix with the civilians. A possible solution is a separate FLTC exclusively for the arrested. With those arrested increasingly testing positive since September, the task is getting progressively difficult,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief.
While the centre has multiple entries and exit points, police are deployed only at the main entrance, which is more than 100 metres away from the facility. “The accused are not always in the sight of the police guards who have to largely depend on information from health and paramedical staff at the centre. We have already petitioned the District Police Chief and now plan to raise it with the District Collector as well,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam Rural) of Kerala Police Association."
8,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asked public representatives and officials to work round-the-clock for the strict implementation of the recent legislations enacted by the State government as they were people-centric and aimed at their welfare.
At a meeting with public representatives of municipalities and Mayors of various other municipal corporations, Mr. Rao said the objective of the legislations is to see that the poor do not suffer in the deliverables of the government. The fruits of the legislations should go up to the last mile, he said.
He asked the participants at the meeting to involve themselves at the grassroots level in the online registration of non-agriculture properties like plots, flats and houses.
As part of revolutionary administrative reforms in the State, the government had enacted several legislations for effective use of people for decades. However, the poor should not be adversely affected in the implementation of the Acts, he said.
Mr. Rao said the government has no intention of filling its purse with money collected from poor through regularisation of lands.
He asked officials to prepare solutions for problems faced by people in regard to lands and properties before the Dharani portal becomes fully operational. The government would solve all problems linked to residential premises and construction sites which piled up for several decades, Mr. Rao said.
Apprehensions
In the initial days of formation of Telangana, people expressed severe apprehensions that land rates will drop. But, the steps taken by government saw to it that the rates of both agricultural and non-agriculture lands peaked. Good governance led to decline in land disputes, land grabbing, harassment and other related anti-social activities, he said.
He expressed confidence that the government's aim to put the poor high in the priority list would be fulfilled when Dharani portal becomes operational. There will be total protection and security to the properties of the poor. Hutments in urban slums will be replaced by buildings and dwelling houses, he said.
In the interaction that followed with the participants, some of them praised Mr.Rao for his insight into problems of rural and urban areas. The meeting was attended by Ministers and MLAs, including those from Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and others senior officials were also present."
9,"The CPI (Maoist) Charla Local Guerrilla Squad (LGS), which is active in the Chennapuram forest stretch that straddles along the restive inter-State border with Chhattisgarh, has lost its commander Sodi Jogaiah, 25, in Wednesday’s alleged exchange of fire between the police and the Maoist rebels in Chennapuram forest area of Charla mandal.
The police on Thursday identified the bodies of the three Maoists, including two women cadres - those killed in the Chennapuram “exchange of fire” as Sodi Jogaiah of Kistarampadu, Madakam Malli, 22, Maoist dalam member, of Chennapuram, both from Charla mandal, and Madakam Mangi, 24, Charla LGS member, of a tribal hamlet in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh's Kukunoor mandal.
Jogaiah was wanted in connection with four murder cases, including the kidnap and murder of former MPTC member N Srinivasa Rao, owing allegiance to the ruling TRS, of Besta Kothuru village in July last year, police sources said.
Sodi Jogaiah, the Charla LGS commander of the outlawed outfit, was involved in as many as 26 cases of Maoist violence in Bhadrachalam Agency, said Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt.
Jogaiah was the main accused in the murder of former MPTC member N Srinivasa Rao of Besta Kothur in 2019 and also wanted in connection with the murder of a villager in Peddamidisileru in 2017, a youth of Pusuguppa village and a farmer in Kurnapalli in Charla mandal in 2018, the SP said.
The bodies of the three Maoists were handed over to their relatives on Thursday afternoon after postmortem at the Government Area Hospital in Bhadrachalam, he said, adding that the police are trying to bring back their bodies and preserve them in freezers at the Government Area Hospital for re-postmortem as per the orders of the Telangana High Court."
10,"The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is looking to install solar lights along its roads in the State. On a trial basis, the project will be carried out on the Krishnagiri-Walajapet National Highway.
""Going solar will help the environment as it is clean energy. It would also cut down the heavy power bills of toll operators. Also, since it is to be connected to the grid, they will get some relief on the investment. Some contractors pay power bills of up to ₹20 lakh a month for road lighting, which could be brought down,” explained a senior official of the NHAI.
As a first step, the toll plazas will get solar lighting. “We have to study the system and see how it functions for a couple of months before we extend solar power to other places along the highway. The concessionaire has already provided lighting at places where there are human habitations,” said another official.
However, the only hitch in the proposal is the low rate of ₹2 per unit being offered by Tangedco.
“Now, commercial connections are charged ₹9 per unit. We are proposing to supply power to the grid. In such a case, a better rate is only fair. The State government should consider our request,” he said. Tangedco sources said they were only collecting the rates on the basis of what had been stipulated by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Authority. “It is not our decision,"" the official said."
11,"Kottayam recorded its highest single-day spike of COVID-19 cases on Thursday with 343 persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2

In view of the surge in cases, the Health Department has revised its treatment strategy by commencing COVID second-line treatment centres (SLTCs) and promoting home care for asymptomatic patients. At the same time, the rising caseload is stretching the treatment network as medium risk and high-risk patients are increasing proportionately.
Taking note of the situation, SLTCs were opened at Pala, Uzhavoor, and Changanassery by converting the First Line Treatment Centres there. The SLTCs are equipped to provide treatment for medium risk patients, while high-risk patients are being treated at the Government Medical College Hospital and the District General Hospital, which are designated as COVID specialty hospitals."

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, accompanied by his Karnataka counterpart B.S. Yediyurappa, took part in the hour-long parayanam, where the pundits not only recited the verses from the sacred religious text but also gave an in-depth narration of their meaning.
Spiritual programmes
The parayanam is a part of the initiative of the TTD, which has been organising a series of such spiritual programmes for the past 168 days invoking the blessings of the Lord to save humanity from the clutches of COVID-19.
Earlier, both the Chief Ministers offered their prayers at the hill temple.
On their arrival at the main temple complex, they were traditionally received by the priests and top TTD officials with temple honours and led into the sanctum sanctorum, where they stood in front of the main deity and offered their prayers. They also visited the sub-temples while going round the temple complex.
After the customary ‘Vedasirvachanams’, the authorities honoured both the Chief Ministers with silk ‘vastrams’ besides presented them a memento and ‘laddu prasadam’.
Later, both the Chief Ministers drove to the Karnataka State Charities, where they formally laid the foundation stone for the construction of a massive choultry.

23,"Seven Indian Police Service officers from various States undergoing Mid-Career Training Programme (MCTP) Phase-III at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA) tested positive for coronavirus.
As they were asymptomatic, the administration isolated them in special facilities on the campus. The primary contact of the victims were also identified and they too were isolated.
Confirming this to The Hindu, NPA Director Atul Karwal said 79 IPS officials from across the country, with seven to nine years of service, came to their alma mater in the second week of September, to prepare themselves for the next level of competency and honing up skills with a global perspective.
“They were quarantined for 10 days after coming to the campus from their cadre. However, online training started on September 14, as per schedule, which they were attending from their accommodations,” he said.
Last weekend, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody tests were conducted on the quarantined officials, and results were out on Tuesday. Of them, seven tested positive.
“Today, we have started regular training for those who tested negative. Classes are being conducted outdoors as a precautionary measure,” the official said.
“We are facing the pandemic and police officers are the frontline force. All of them have worked as COVID warriors in their States, and for them the chance of infection was obviously high,” Mr. Karwal said, adding that some might have contracted the virus during their journey to Hyderabad. The infected officials were allowed to attend classes online.
He said the NPA could not suspend the training programmes as its alumni were battling from the front. “We are here to set an example,” he said.

33,"With a new high of 6,324 coronavirus (COVID-19) cases on Thursday in Kerala, the pandemic’s course appeared to match projections of a peak in mid-September to the first week of October.
The steep rise was evident from the jump of over 1,000 cases in a day. The State also hiked testing in a 24-hour-period from 51,200 samples on Wednesday to 54,989 on Thursday.
Cumulative cases stood at 1,54,456, and patients treated in hospitals at 45,919. Of these, 371 patients were critically ill and in ICUs, 96 of them on ventilator support.
The State’s toll was also surging, at 613 fatalities, with 21 more deaths added to the toll on Thursday. These occurred between September 4 and 22. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 11 deaths, Alapuzha seven, while one death each was reported from Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode.
Nearly 96% of new cases were locally acquired infections.

34,"The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) Hyderabad has developed a low-cost rechargeable N 95 mask with an increased efficacy.
This has been achieved by using graphene oxide-based paint on one of the layers of the mask.
According to Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, regular N 95 masks filter particles which are 0.3 microns in size with an efficiency of 95%.
“While the fibres of the mask pose as a mechanical barrier, an electrostatic charge on the surface of the mask traps particles. With usage, the electrostatic charge on the N95 masks erodes away, thus, decreasing the filtering efficiency of the mask. To address this bottleneck, researchers in TIFR Hyderabad have developed a low-cost rechargeable N95 mask,” a statement from TIFR reads.
The mask is reusable after standard decontamination procedures without losing its efficiency. It can be recharged with small movements such as the movement of the jaw.
The research was led by Dr. G. Rajalakshmi and Prof. T.N. Narayan along with graduate students Stelbin Peter Figerez and Sudeshna Patra. The researchers have also developed a device for testing masks for quality."

38,"Corporate India has got three more months of relief from invocation of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings by lenders, with the government extending the suspension of relevant provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) against firms defaulting on their loans since March 25 this year.
The IBC’s invocation was first suspended for a period of six months in view of the emergent stress on balance sheets due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the national lockdown announced in March. The Corporate Affairs Ministry notified a further three-month extension on Thursday evening, when that six-month period was due to end.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the extension of the suspension of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC reinforces the government’s commitment to protecting businesses. “It also gives companies breathing time to recover from financial stress,” she said in a tweet. The government had issued an ordinance to amend the IBC in June to enable the suspension of the Code’s provisions for firms committing defaults after March 25. The ordinance permits the government to extend the suspension of insolvency invocation for up to one year, and was passed as a legislation by Parliament this week.
‘Result still elusive’
“The notification was expected but the desired result is still elusive,” said Anoop Rawat, partner, insolvency and bankruptcy at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.
“The rate of stress resolution outside IBC is abysmal and the stress is only accumulating,” he added. Mr. Rawat hoped the three months could be used to build stakeholder consensus on resolving the stress created on account of COVID-19 to avoid further build-up of stress at the end of the period.
While the economy contracted more than 23% in the first quarter, when the harshest lockdown restrictions were in place, the industry is yet to see a significant revival in revenues as consumers remain cautious and hold on to cash amid a surge in novel coronavirus infections and dwindling jobs and incomes.
The suspension of the corporate insolvency resolution process for another three months will help companies stay afloat, said Uttara Kolhatkar, partner at J. Sagar Associates.
“The current COVID-19 situation has had a debilitating effect on the Indian economic situation and the passing of the Bill will give such stressed companies the much–needed cushioning effect,” she added."

Liver ducts affected
Tejanshu, son of Lakshman and Rajitha from Jannaram mandal, Cherlapalli, was brought to the hospital with a rare disease called Congenital Biliary Atresia (CBA). In this disorder, liver ducts do not develop, and that leads to jaundice and liver failure.
The team of doctors at Pratima Hospitals, Kacheguda, led by senior surgical gastroenterologist Ch. Madhusudan, and gastroenterologist and hepatologist B. Ramesh Kumar, successfully performed the live donor liver transplantation surgery.
Donor father
A portion of the liver was taken from the child’s father and transplanted on him, doctors said.
In a statement here, the doctors said that doing a liver transplant in children is very difficult and needs high skills and expertise because children’s blood vessels are very tiny and lead to liver failure or surgery failure.
The most important thing is the need to perform the surgery with minimal blood loss in children, and so we did it meticulously under a magnifying loop and we did it successfully, said Dr. Madhusudan assuring that in future too, they would do free surgical procedures for the needy.

It has come to the notice of the coordination committee that many people with symptoms of fever, cold and cough had resorted to self-medication before they were tested postive for the virus.
“We found that self-medication delayed the detection of the infection in many patients by a week or more and it led to serious health complications. This is one of the major reasons for the spread of the virus,” Indian Medical Association president (Tirupati region) P. Ravi Raju, who is a member of the COVID-19 coordination committe, told the media here on Thursday.
The committee members are meeting regularly to discuss the spread of the virus and functioning of the COVID-19 facilities in the district.
“The committe members, after a meeting here, said people taking self-medication was predominantly witnessed in the rural areas. Cases of people put under home isolation violating the norms have also come to our notice,” said Dr. Ravi Raju said.
The officials working at the triage centers have been instructed to discourage the patients from rural areas to opt for home isolation.
High recovery rate
“At present, the district has around 10,000 active cases, of which 6,000 are under home isolation. Even as more than 56,000 cases have been reported from the district till date, the recovery rate of more than 85% is quite a relief. However, we should not be complascent and lay focus on checking the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Ravi Raju.
Eighteen special teams of medical and paramedical staff have been working round the clock, covering the government COVID19 facilities set up at Tirupati, Chittoor, Madanapalle, Srikalahasti and Kuppam.
Co-morbid condition
The virus has claimed 620 lives in the district till date. “Majority of the victims had co-morbid health conditions who underwent tests much after they developed symptoms.
“People with symptoms of fever should undergo tests without delay. This is the best remedy to arrest the spread of the virus. Early detection of the infection and timely treatment help can save more lives,” the IMA functionary said."
48,"Deposition by children from the orphanage could become crucial evidence in the case pertaining to sexual assault in a protection home at Ameenpur, registered over a month and a half ago.
The victim of sexual assault, a 14-year-old girl, died last month, while undergoing treatment at Niloufer Hospital.
While the forensic science laboratory report is awaited to ascertain the exact cause of the girl’s death, it is reliably learnt that a few children rescued from the ‘Maruthi Orphanage’ deposed before the Judicial Magistrate of Sangareddy, confirming sexual assault on the girl.
Officials hope that the statements could be a key evidence against the accused — a donor who frequented the home — and two caretakers. Besides, the committee constituted by the Commissioner, Women Development and Child Welfare for probing the case is learnt to have recorded corroborative evidence that confirms sexual assault. The committee, with members drawn from the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, WD &CW, and the Police department, has submitted its preliminary report to the commissioner. Final report will be prepared once the forensic test report arrives.
Commissioner, WD & CD, D. Divya has reportedly written to the government, seeking appointment of a special public prosecutor to argue the case.
The girl’s statement had already been recorded twice, once by the Child Welfare Committee of Rangareddy district, and then by the SCPCR in the government home at Nimboli Adda where the girl was given shelter after a police complaint was filed.
In her statement, the girl pointed finger at primary accused Venugopal Reddy, who visited the home often as “donor”, and caretaker of the home Ch.Vijaya.
The girl said she would be given cool drink and sexually assaulted after she lost consciousness. She would be woken up by other girls in the orphanage, to find herself naked in bed on fifth floor of the building housing the home.
She was abruptly sent away from the home in April this year, on the pretext of pandemic spread. However, family members who took her home found that she was extremely sick, and, upon repeated entreaties, the girl confided in them. After a police complaint was registered, the girl was referred to the government-run protection home and when the situation worsened, she was taken to Niloufer Hospital, where she breathed her last.
The orphanage was seized, and all other children there were rescued and shifted first to various private homes functioning under the WD&CW department, and later to the State Home premises in Yousufguda."
49,"In a setback to trade unions, the Karnataka High Court on Thursday rejected their petitions challenging the legality of amendment made to the labour law extending flexible hiring facility under the ‘fixed-term workmen’ (FTW) policy to all industries.
The court held that there was nothing wrong in the process followed by the State government in amending the Karnataka Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1961, nor is creation of new category of employment under FTW contrary to the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act.
A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order while rejecting the petition filed by Karnataka Industrial and Other Establishments’ Employees Federation.
The petitioner had questioned the legality of the notification issued by the government in June making changes to rules to expand the facility of FTW to all industries as it was available only for the apparel manufacturing sector earlier.
After perusing the records maintained by the government, the Bench declined to accept the contention of the petitioner that no consultation was held with the trade unions before amending the rules. The Bench said the process followed by the government adheres to the manner of holding consultation prescribed by the apex court while noticing that the objections filed by the trade unions to the draft rules were put up by the Commissioner of Labour before the government, which at three levels, Additional Chief Secretary (Labour), Minister for Labour and the Chief Minister had considered the common objections raised by the unions before approving the FTW rule.
Also, the Bench said that the facility of FTW does not violate the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act as it creates a separate employment category on contract basis having pay and other facilities payable equal to permanent employees except that period of employment would not get extended. The Bench also found no merit in the contention of the petitioner that new law violates constitutional provisions.
Employment under the FTW category allows flexibility for industries to hire and fire employees easily. It is seen as more flexible than the contract system, as it enables industries to hire people when a necessary arises and terminate their services when the necessity ceases to exist."

51,"The economy of Tumari and its surrounding villages — approachable only by a barge — is dependent on the Chowdeshwari temple in Sigandur, which used to attract thousands of devotees from different parts of the State. But the temple’s closure for six months and it now being opened only for darshan, sans special pujas, have meant a blow to the economy of several villages.
When this reporter visited Tumari, there were hardly any hotels open. The owner of one hotel was preparing to wind up his business for the day as early as 9 a.m. “There are hardly any visitors. I prepared only dosa and sambar for the day. Our business depends on devotees visiting Sigandur temple,” said Krishna, owner of the hotel.
A majority of the people on the island on the backwaters of Sharavathi are farmers. They have to cross the backwater with the help of barges to reach the mainland. For decades after the construction of Linganamakki dam in 1960s, they hardly saw any development. However, in the last two decades, Sigandur temple became popular, attracting devotees from different parts of the State. It brought in many changes to the lives of people there. “Around 20,000 people are dependent on the temple. Besides hotels, lodges, petty shops, there are around 30 jeep drivers, who carry visitors to the temple soon after they get down the barge. They have no source of income for months. Petty shops at Holebagilu and Kalasavahalli are closed,” said G.T. Satyanarayana, former president of Tumari Gram Panchayat.
Meanwhile, the differences within the administration of the temple have prompted many people to urge the State government to take over the temple, which is right now handled by a private trust.
Shivamogga district administration had submitted a proposal to the government for bringing the temple under the Muzrai Department in 2005 itself, but it has not happened since."
52,"Booking of cases against two city-based jewellery shop owners by the Central Bureau of Investigation brings to the fore the fact of bullion traders taking loans several times more than the value of the yellow metal with a view to make a killing. All is fine as long as the bullion merchants, who speculate on the future price of the yellow metal in the commodities market, service the debts secured from commercial banks without any problem.
They land in a serious trouble when the business plans go haywire. Their accounts turn non-performing when they are not in a position even to pay interest on loans as the price of the yellow metal turns volatile due to developments at the global level, police sources here say referring to the cases filed against Shantilal and Son Jewellers and Shanti Kalash Jewellers on a complaint from a public sector bank for alleged misappropriation of ₹70.13 crore.
Banks prefer to sanction term loan as also overdraft facility to gold merchants in view of the reputation enjoyed by them in the society without fully understanding their business dealings which take turn for the worse in the wake of the fluctuation in the price of the precious metal, the sources say.
Involvement of the loan sanctioning authorities in the banks could not also be ruled out, they add referring to the two cases wherein the owners had secured loan on the pretext of renovating their shops on the Achari street from the Canara Bank branch(then Syndicate Bank branch) at Dargamitta here.
''We will extend all assistance to the CBI if sought to unravel the conspiracy in full,'' they add referring to the cases filed on complaints from the Stressed Management Branch of the bank."

Interim Louisville police chief Robert Schroeder said a suspect was in custody but did not offer details about whether that person was participating in the demonstrations. He said both officers are expected to recover, and one is undergoing surgery.
Several shots rang out as protesters in downtown Louisville tried to avoid police blockades, moving down an alleyway as officers lobbed pepper balls, according to an Associated Press journalist. People covered their ears, ran away and frantically looked for places to hide. Police with long guns swarmed the area, then officers in riot gear and military-style vehicles blocked off roadways.
The violence comes after prosecutors said two officers, who fired their weapons at Taylor, a Black woman, were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend. The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside.
No justice, no peace
The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in connection with the raid at Taylor’s home on March 13.
Ben Crump, a lawyer for Taylor’s family, denounced the decision as “outrageous and offensive,” and protesters shouting, “No justice, no peace!” immediately marched through the streets.
Scuffles broke out between police and protesters, and some of them were arrested."
55,"In order to understand the diversity of behaviour among elephants and use the knowledge to reduce human-elephant interactions, the Forest Department has started profiling of individual elephants in Coimbatore Forest Division.
In the initial stage, male elephants will be profiled using images of individual animals obtained using camera traps and cameras operated by the field staff.
“Each elephant is different in terms of diversity of behaviour. The profiling helps to identify those elephants that are habituated to human habitats and engage in negative interactions. Such elephants account to a very minuscule population and targeted strategies can be applied to reduce their interaction with humans,” said I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle.
Mr. Anwardeen had implemented profiling of elephants in collaboration with Shola Trust in Gudalur where around 150 elephants were photographed and profiles for 90 individuals were created in three years from 2015.
The exercise had categorised elephants in four categories: transient ones that stay for a very short time during migration season, residents that are shy and never come to human habitation, brash youngsters that engage in crop raiding or attack people in conflict situation, and highly habituated old animals that stay close to humans but barely attack.
Multiple photographs and observation notes of an individual elephant help to create a profile based on its height, age, shape of tusks, shape of tail, pattern of ears and other unique features.
As part of the exercise in Coimbatore Forest Division, where 11 people were killed in elephant attacks and 20 elephants died of various reasons including gunshot in the current year, camera traps have already been placed in 20 key locations in different forest ranges.
“Training for the profiling have been given to all the staff in the forest division ranging from anti-poaching watcher to foresters. Apart from the camera traps fixed in forests, the department has plans to buy cameras for the field staff for the purpose,” said D. Boominathan, landscape coordinator of WWF India, Coimbatore, which is assisting the Department in the log-term exercise.
Places where camera traps have been fixed include Thadagam valley which witnesses movement of elephant to and fro Kerala. Cameras have also been fixed in Sirumugai, Periyanaickenpalayam and Karamadai forest ranges.
According to the Forest Department, moving population of elephant is high in Coimbatore division which is located in the southernmost part of a larger landscape called south Nilgiri Elephant Range - 8 under Project Elephant. Range - 8 consists of two elephant reserves namely Nilambur elephant reserve and Coimbatore elephant reserve, overall elephant population is about 600 as per some studies."

Stating that once a melee happens, like the Galwan clash on June 15, opening fire was not possible, the official pointed out, “Now, we said, if you come close we will fire. Distance is dependent on the conditions like day or night, location and so on... If they are about to be overrun or in self-defence, troops are authorised to fire.”
At the sixth round of Corps Commander talks early this week, India and China had agreed not to send any more troops to the frontline. “It is a good start. We have to wait and watch till there is concrete action on the ground, we will not lower our guard on the ground. Our stand is you moved first, so you move back first. That will be a good confidence-building measure (CBM),” the official said.
The sixth round of senior-level military-level talks also saw a joint statement being issued as well as the participation of an External Affairs Ministry official who deals with China, the official stated. Earlier, the Chinese side had tried to project that India did not have a “unified” stance on the continuing boundary stand-offs.
At the talks since the developments on the south bank since August 29, the Chinese want to resolve the latest incidents first, but India favoured a package resolution of the entire eastern Ladakh situation. “When we say status quo, what we mean is status quo before May,” the official stated.
Chinese deaths
The official revealed that the Chinese had conveyed through diplomatic channels that they had suffered five deaths, including their commanding officer, in the June 15 Galwan Valley clash, which left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead.
Asked why the Chinese had acted in the way they did, the official felt there was “no one overarching reason” but many reasons, including turning Jammu and Kashmir into a Union Territory in August 2019 and also to divert attention from China’s COVID-19 crisis.
Pointing out that the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in other sectors remains stable, the official said that local commanders on both sides were in contact and even they (the Chinese) had said: “Let not what’s happening in eastern Ladakh happen here”.
Interestingly, in the eastern sector, Indian and Chinese troops patrol contentious areas by weekly rotation, a formula that could be brought into play in eastern Ladakh as well.
The official asserted that there was no intelligence failure in detecting the Chinese movements in early May as they made ingress into the Indian side of the LAC. “Whoever moves first has the initiative and the first mover advantage,” the official, said stating they had been monitoring the Chinese all along.
Currently, troops are facing each other at Depsang, the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, and Patrolling Points 17A, Rezang La and Rechin La.
On possible collusion between China and Pakistan against India in the ongoing stand-off, the official said there was no major troop movement on the Line of Control (LoC), and only regular battalion movement was taking place.
“Nothing unusual on that front. We don’t see any build on the other side. But terror activities continue. We are quite strong on the ground, so we eliminate the threat on the LoC,” the official said.
On the global support to India in the ongoing stand-off and the transgressions by China and engagement with Quad countries, the official said: “At the end of the day, you have to fight your own battles”.
On the situation in the Depsang plains, where Chinese troops continue to block Indian patrols to the Patrolling Points 10-13, the official said there were one or two Chinese vehicles near the Y-junction, which kept going back and forth. Beyond the Y-junction, Indian patrols had to go on foot, which were being blocked by Chinese vehicles, the official stated, adding that patrol parties followed protocols and returned. “We have not given up our claims. It has only been temporarily halted due to the circumstances,” the official said."

69,"Manufacturers of corrugated boxes are facing steep increase in cost of raw materials and other inputs and are thus staring at huge losses, according to the Indian Corrugated Case Manufacturers’ Association.
The Indian corrugated box industry, with over 350 automatic corrugators and more than 10,000 semi-automatic units, has seen kraft paper mills increase prices steeply and other conversion input costs spiralling. Overall, there is 18 % to 20 % hike in input costs.
The kraft paper mills say that price of domestic and imported waste paper has increased in the last two months. Since China proposes to ban waste paper imports with effect from January 1, 2021, it is consuming the supplies available now in the global market and this has pushed the prices up. Further, with lockdowns all over the globe due to COVID-19, generation of water paper has fallen. The Indian paper mills could not import adequate volumes during lockdown periods resulting in lower inventory of required grades and shortage in some lower grades.
Sandeep Wadhwa, president of the Indian Corrugated Case Manufacturers Association, appealed to the kraft paper mills to stabilise the prices and to ensure that supply chain in not hampered during the recovery phase. Harish Madan, vice president of the Association, said that unless the box users, including large FMCG brand owners, support the industry, its survival will be difficult."

The centres are being upgraded along the lines of the unit at Marappanapalya ward, which received a facelift after Hasiru Dala, a non-government organisation working on waste management, collaborated with a Netherlands-based firm.
The civic body chose 10 DWCCs in Atturu, Yelahanka Satellite, Jakkur, Kuvempu Nagar, Nagawara, H.B.R. Layout, Rajamahal Guttahalli, Koramangala and Kengeri (159) wards for the first part of the upgradation at a cost of ₹4.75 crore.
“Work on the DWCCs at H.B.R. Layout and Koramangala wards have been completed,” said officials in the BBMP’s Solid Waste Management (SWM) cell. Two centres are likely to be ready by the end of September.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the project by a couple of months, an official said but added that it is now back on track.
The BBMP decided to upgrade the DWCCs last year after an audit of all the centres in the city. The audit was taken up to understand the gaps that exist with respect to operations – from infrastructure, capacity to the financial model. The audit had revealed that 23 DWCCs were unfit for operation, 68 needed minor renovation while 52 could be expanded.
Around 120 DWCCs were servicing 126 wards.
“With the new garbage tenders stressing on separate collection and transportation of different streams of waste, there is a need for all wards to have a DWCC,” said Sarfaraz Khan, BBMP’s Joint Commissioner (SWM).
Officials had been directed to identify locations for setting up new DWCCs in the 78 wards. “The locations are likely to be finalised by the year-end,” Mr. Khan added."
76,"The IPL lost one of its side attractions on Thursday. Dean Jones' untimely demise has robbed the tournament of one of its most perceptive and entertaining commentators.
It may be no exaggeration to say that Jones the commentator had more followers in India than back home in Australia. Remember how he used to dress up as an academician during his stint as Professor Deano for NDTV?
He extended Australia's long tradition of excellent cricketers-turned-commentators. The likes of Ian Chappell, Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry elevated Channel 9 and now Brett Lee, Jones’ colleague on Star Sports Dugout, is a delight too.
Jones, however, had to live through one terrible phase when he was sacked by Ten Sports after he made an insensitive description of Hashim Amla during the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at Colombo in 2006. He regretted his mistake and was able to win back the broadcaster's faith.

 Jones could put a smile on the viewer's face, with his sense of humour. He would also showcase his knowledge of Hindi, like if 52 was needed for victory, he would say: “They now need to make baawan.”
Scott Styris, former New Zealand all-rounder and now a fine analyst, always managed to bring the best out of Jones. During a recent IPL broadcast, Styris was talking to Lee about the speed of pace bowlers. “I was happy with my bowling,” Styris said. “The batsmen were also happy with your bowling,” quipped Jones.
It is hard to believe Jones is no more. You will be missed, Deano!"

78,"The indefinite strike by Karnataka State Health and Medical Education Department Contractual Employees’ Forum and Karnataka AIDS Prevention Society Contract Workers’ Association has partially hit COVID-19 surveillance, testing and reporting in the State.
Over 30,000 employees affiliated to these associations abstained from work starting Thursday demanding pay parity and COVID-19 incentives. While the government has announced COVID-19 incentives for doctors and paramedical staff working under the National Health Mission, it has excluded a majority of staffers on COVID-19 duty.
Protesting this disparity, NHM staffers deployed at Primary Health Centres, taluk and district hospitals apart from COVID-19 Care Centres did not report for work on Thursday.
The protest’s impact was also visible in the COVID-19 health bulletin issued by the Health Department on Thursday. The State reported 7,710 new cases and 65 deaths. Although this is marginally higher than that reported on Wednesday, the numbers are lower than average, which is attributed to the protest.
The total cases went up to 5,48,557 and the toll rose to 8,331. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths. With 6,748 discharges, the total recoveries rose to 4,44,658. Of the remaining 95,549 active cases, 827 patients are being monitored in ICUs of various hospitals.
The number of tests continued to remain lesser that the average 75,000 per day. Only 64,164 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 23,232 rapid antigen tests. Bengaluru Urban saw a record 4,192 cases, the highest single-day spike so far."
79,"In a year of grim tidings, the demise of Dean Jones in Mumbai on Thursday is the latest hammer-blow. Sport has lost an effervescent cricketing star, who made a smooth transition to the commentary box with his swagger and zest intact.
During his prime, the former Australian batsman was all energy and aggression.
He exuded an aura in One Day Internationals (ODI), with shots that blended the conventional and the unorthodox while embellishing it with frenetic running between the wickets.
Jones, Deano to his friends, was a sharp fielder too and he was part of the 1987 World Cup-winning squad helmed by the indomitable Allan Border.
The Madras classic
After a tearful Kim Hughes resigned and left the reins of a weakened Aussie unit to Border in 1984, the latter identified Jones as one of his vital cogs, who along with David Boon, Geoff Marsh, Steve Waugh and Craig McDermott, could revive Australia.
Jones and ODIs shared an adrenaline-loaded bond but he is often remembered for his rousing 210 in the famous Tied Test at Chennai, Madras then, in 1986.
One of the defining pictures of the historic Tied Test was Dean Jones battling heat and dehydration to rack up a superb 210.  
   The enduring images of him batting relentlessly despite the southern metro’s searing heat, egged on by a ruthless Border, is the stuff of legend.
Jones later admitted that he urinated in his pants, vomited on the turf, but soldiered on as his captain wanted him to stay at the wicket.
The Test’s anniversary recently passed us by and just as those old pictures of Jones emerged, he now lies cold in Mumbai. Life’s myriad turns could not be starker!
Broadcast embrace
After a decade of cricket for Australia, the Victorian embraced television, became a perennial fixture in commentary boxes, forged new friendships and was always eager to have a chat.
He could be politically incorrect too and a ghastly word he used to describe South African great Hashim Amla, put Jones to pasture. He apologised profusely and reintegrated himself with the media bandwagon that tails the willow game.
At 59, he had many years of good talk and booming laughter left in him but his heart deemed otherwise and cricket is poorer."

83,"The COVID-19 epidemic is plotting a path almost similar to the projections which spoke of a possible peak in the epidemic curve mid-September to the first week of October.
The exponential rise in the case graph was evident with the State registering 6,324 cases on Thursday, quite a jump by over 1,000 cases registered the previous day.
The State also hiked the number of samples tested in the past 24 hours from 51,200 on Wednesday to 54,989 samples on Thursday. However, it is not quite clear what proportion of these tests are done in the private sector.
The number of recoveries reported on the day was 3,168.
The cumulative case burden now stands at 1,54,456. With 1,07,850 recoveries reported so far, the number of patients currently undergoing treatment in hospitals is 45,919. Of these, 371 patients are critically ill and in intensive care units, with 96 patients on ventilatory support.
The State’s death toll is also surging steadily in proportion to the rise in the total number of cases and now stands at 613, with 21 more deaths being added to the official toll on Thursday. These are deaths which occurred between September 4 to 22. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 11 deaths, Alappuzha 7, while one death each was reported from Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode.
Close to 96% of the new cases —6,054 out of the 6,324 new cases reported on Thursday — are locally acquired infections, including infections reported in 105 health-care workers. In 628 of the cases, the source of infection remains unknown.
The sudden rise in the number of cases put Kozhikode with 883 new cases at the top of all districts. Thiruvananthapuram closely followed with 875 cases, Malappuram 763, Ernakulam 590, Thrissur 474, Alappuzha 453, Kollam 440, Kannur 406, Palakkad 353, Kottayam 341, Kasaragod 300, Pathanamthitta 189, Idukki 151 and Wayanad 106.
The surge in daily case burden is naturally reflected in the number of active cases in each district with Thiruvananthapuram having the maximum number of active patients at 8,446. Kozhikode has 4,927 and Ernakulam, 4,691 patients. Except for Idukki and Wayanad, all other districts have active cases in four-digits.

88,"The Uzhavar Sandhai that was shuttered here as part of COVID-19 containment measures will be reopened in the same location only after number of cases returned to zero. The farmers’ market has since been relocated to two different locations, with the breakup of stalls.
The Uzhavar Sandhai that was a huge draw among Hosur residents was shuttered pre-emptively to avoid an outbreak, especially due to its location. The old farmers’ market was sited on a location with a narrow approach road causing heavy congestion. In its wake, the market was closed to avoid build-up of clusters taking cue from the experience of Koyambedu cluster.
The market was bifurcated with number of stalls divided to be set up on the road abutting Ramanayakkan Lake and at the MGR market for another group. Amid queries of the relocation of market back to its original spot, the corporation has no plans of moving the market back to its erstwhile location as the number of cases in Hosur was steadily spiking on a daily basis.
According to Hosur Corporation Commissioner Balasubramaniam, for now, the Uzhavar Sandhai will continue to operate from its two temporary locations. “The market will not be moved back, until the number of cases came down to zero.”"
89,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is the latest agency to turn its gaze on the actors and party organisers who have been arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) in connection with an alleged drug racket. But this time, it’s the financial activities of the accused that are under the scanner.
The ED on Thursday obtained permission to question actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani as well as three others for alleged money laundering.
During the bail application hearing in the NDPS Court, Special Public Prosecutor P. Prasanna Kumar filed an application seeking permission for the ED to question the accused about their financial activities. Admitting the plea, the court granted the agency permission to question party organiser Viren Khanna, another accused Rahul Thonse, second division clerk in the RTO Ravishankar as well as Ragini and Sanjjanaa for five days at Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara where they are lodged.
Mr. Prasanna Kumar submitted that the CCB, during the course of its investigation, found that the accused financed drug trafficking and earned money from the activity. The ED, through its counsel, stated that in order to unearth and trace the financial trail, it was essential to know details of the property purchased by the accused and investments made.
The counsel cited the recent suspension of Assistant Commissioner of Police M.R. Mudhavi for allegedly helping the accused in return for a payment of ₹50 lakh. He allegedly received ₹12 lakh as an advance from the accused.
“With this, it can be estimated that the accused have huge amount of unaccounted money, which needs to be probed,” Mr. Prasanna Kumar said.
Resort owner summoned
CCB officials, as part of the investigation, summoned Bengaluru-based resort owner Karthik Raju for questioning. According to the police, the accused had organised a party at his resort where drugs were sold and consumed.
“We are probing in detail to ascertain his possible involvement in the racket,” a senior police officer said.
CCB special teams are still searching for three of the prime accused, including Aditya Alva, the son of the late Jeevaraj Alva who served as minister, and party organiser Sheikh Fazil.
Accused tests positive
One of the accused arrested by the CCB has tested positive for COVID-19. According to the police, he is one of the party organisers who is close to several celebrities.
“CCB officials had taken him into police custody for further questioning but on Thursday, his results came positive. He has been shifted to a private hospital for treatment,” said a senior police official.

Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu said that instead of taking action against the accused, the Chief Minister was trying to shield the Minister.

The State had become the first to provide food kits to transgender persons in the first phase of lockdown in March. With the spike in disease, transgender persons have been facing a difficult time.
The government has now sanctioned food kits to the tune of ₹700 each to 1,000 transgender persons who have ID cards, those who have completed screening for the cards, and those who have applied for it.
However, this number forms only a small percentage of the total number of transgender persons in the State. A socio-economic survey in 2014-15 had estimated the number of transgenders in the State at 25,000. They have been further pushed to the margins of society by the pandemic.
Apoorva, a transgender person, used to work as a cook at the Social Justice Department’s shelter for transwomen at Karakkamandapam here but after it closed down, had no income. Consequently, Apoorva had to move back home with her parents. She is also worried about how to meet the hospital expenses of her parents.
Ruby, who too had worked at the same shelter home, had taken up fish business. But after a friend died, all the savings were wiped out. She has not been working since. The rent on her house has been adjusted against the advance, but with no money in hand, she has no option but to move out the next month.
Community members say the food kits provided by the government or the assistance of ₹1,500 provided by the National Institute of Social Defence are only a drop in the ocean. Some have got a breather after shifting to the shelter homes run by the community under a government project.
The increase in funds sanctioned for sex reassignment surgery from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh and self-employment loans announced by the KSWDC are welcome steps, but financial assistance is necessary to tide over the difficult times, they say.
Their hopes are now pinned on a proposal for government assistance of ₹1,000 for 800 transgender persons."

Bobde on Thursday.
The case was listed as number 14 before the Bench. However, it was among several cases on the list which was shifted to “court number 31” for hearing on September 28.
Advocate Ejaz Maqbool, who represents the Jamiat petition and is led by senior advocate Dushyant Dave in court, said in the letter that the case was deleted from the list in the morning. He said the remark about the transfer of the case to “court number 31” was “erroneous”. A list on the court website shows only 10 virtual courts, including the Registrar court, functioning.
The letter addressed to the SC Registry said the media portrayal of a section of the population has affected lives and livelihoods.
“It is relevant to note that this matter is of utmost urgency as there has been a demonisation of a large section of Indians due to the communal twist given to the Nizamuddin Markaz issue, which is affecting the life, livelihood and dignity of such persons so much so that their shops/businesses are being boycotted, they are being attacked, and in some cases even being refused treatment by doctors,” the letter read.
In his e-mail to the Supreme Court Registry, Mr. Maqbool also pointed out that the case was supposed to have been listed on September 23, going by an earlier order.

Also read: Congress to launch nationwide stir against agriculture legislations
In the first of a series of nationwide press conferences that the party plans to hold over the next one month in its campaign against these laws, Mr. Singhvi said the farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, did not explicitly mention MSP anywhere.
The government’s claim was technically correct, that these laws did not explicitly say that the provision of MSP had been removed. But the laws gave the freedom to buy and sell the produce at any cost. “The government’s half-truth is far bigger than any lie”, he stated.
Picking other flaws in the Bills, he said that they gave licence to hoarders. They had liberalised the farm sector, allowing the corporate sector to purchase directly from farms and there was no dispute resolution mechanism in case the farmer felt short-changed, he observed.
These laws, Mr. Singhvi asserted, were unconstitutional, as they legally infringed on the division of power set out by the Constitution between the State and the Centre.
Research study on Bihar
Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh posted a 2019 study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research on Bihar, where, in 2006, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act was abolished.

The main five findings of the report were: it led to a deterioration of public infrastructure, situation of small and marginal farmers remained unchanged as they continued to sell their produce to village-level intermediaries, left a regulatory vacuum in the State and poor public procurement, increased the number of intermediaries and did not attract large-scale private sector investment."
100,"The police have registered a case in connection with what is said to be a fraudulent transfer of ₹ 75.59 lakh from the Shorapur Tahsildar’s account.
Shorapur Police have booked a woman for transferring the funds from the account of Shorapur Tahsildar to the account of Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises, Talikoti in Vijayapura district, on June 1 this year.
According to the police, who quoted Tahsildar of Shorapur Ninganna Biradar as saying in his complaint, accused Lakshmi, wife of Raju Kattimani and a native of Vajjal village in Hunsagi taluk, said to be the owner of Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises, has fraudulently transferred a sum of ₹ 75,59,900 from the account of Shorapur Tahsildar through forgery of the tahsildar’s signature and using the official stamp on a cheque of the Tahsildar that had not been given to Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises.
Mr. Biradar has been handling an official account in the name of Tahsildar Shorapur with Axis Bank in Shorapur and the amount was in this account to be used for natural disaster relief and for expenses that would incur for tackling COVID-19.
An FIR said that the issue came to light on September 22 when Mr. Biradar went to inspect the statement of the account provided by the bank. “The amount of ₹ 75.59 lakh was fraudulently transferred by the accused to an account in the name of Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises when I was under long-term treatment in a hospital in Kalaburagi and later in Hyderabad for COVID-19 and pneumonia infection,” the Tahsildar has stated in the complaint.

104,"Residents of some villages have taken objection to the State government’s plans to form residential layouts in villages surrounding Belagavi city, saying that they would lose their fertile land.
They said that the Belagavi Urban Development Authority was making efforts to acquire land in 28 villages for creating layouts.
This issue was raised in the taluk panchayat meeting here on Tuesday. Some members said that gram panchayats in all the 28 villages had received notice about land acquisition for construction of residential layouts for urban residents.
Taluk panchayat president Shankargouda Patil said that a resolution would be passed against this and sent to the State government.
However, BUDA officials refuted this. “No notice has been sent for formation of layouts. There is a proposal before the State government to expand the jurisdiction of BUDA. That is yet to be approved,” a senior BUDA officer said. “There is no plan or proposal for acquiring land for residential layouts in any of the new areas, as of now,” BUDA Commissioner Preetam Naslapure said.
BUDA, one of the biggest city development authorities in the State, has a spread of over 192 square kilometres. It stretches from villages such as Kakati and Kangrali on one side and Savgaon, Mandolli and Peeranwadi on the other.
When expanded, it will encompass the Belagavi airport in Sambra, Yallur, Navage and Kadoli on the four sides. The proposal has been forwarded by the district administration to the State government.
Once the new areas are included, then the rules set by BUDA on land use and house construction will have to be followed. Regulations on creating new layouts and residential and commercial complexes will also have to be adhered to. A vision document is being prepared, along with a comprehensive development plan. A detailed plan of the city will be prepared using Geographical Information Systems, under the Centrally aided AMRUT Scheme.
BUDA’s plans for layout development under the farmers partnership scheme is also being opposed.
The urban body plans to take over farm land from those willing to sell, develop it into layouts and offer half of the number of sites developed to farmers so that they can sell them to whoever they want. BUDA will, however, allocate its sites to those who apply for them, under government rates.
It has an on-going project on Kanabaragi Road that was challenged in court earlier. It has been cleared now and BUDA will develop the layout in 140 acres, excluding the 160 acres that is under dispute.
Similar plans are afoot in Jhadshahapur, Hindalga and Anagol villages. A few days ago, residents of Anagol and Halaga villages submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner’s office urging the government to drop the idea of creating residential layouts in these villages under farmers partnership scheme. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath has assured them of looking into their concerns."
105,"A day after the monsoon session of Parliament ended amid a flurry of protests by the Opposition over three farm Bills, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar demanded that the Congress first disassociate itself from its own 2019 poll manifesto that promised the same agricultural reforms as done by the Modi government. “If Rahul Gandhi agrees with the Congress manifesto of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then he should join efforts in educating farmers,” Mr. Tomar said.
Addressing a presser at the BJP headquarters here, Mr. Tomar reiterated the government’s commitment to farmers’ welfare and said the new measures would bring them remunerative price for their produce. He also said the government was open to holding talks with farmers to assuage any doubts among them on the efficacy of the reforms. “If any farmer wants to speak to any government representative on these Bills even at midnight, we are ready,” he said.
Responding to the demand by the Opposition that continuation of the minimum support price (MSP) should be mentioned in the law, he said the MSP was always an administrative decision. “Why did the Congress not bring a law during its 50 years of rule if it thinks this was necessary,” he asked. He also cited reports of various commissions and reported views of Sharad Pawar, who was Agriculture Minister in the UPA government, to assert that these Bills are in line with their recommendations.
‘Withdraw manifesto’
Asked about Mr. Gandhi’s charge that the Modi government had harmed farmers and was now doing “PR”, Mr. Tomar said the Congress leader should first withdraw his party’s manifesto if he wanted to oppose the Bills.
The new laws will allow farmers to get paid for their produce in advance, help them move products which will fetch them better price and allow them to sell their produce outside agriculture ‘mandis’ without paying any taxes, he said.
“Farmers, so far, were forced to sell their produce in mandis. In Punjab, there’s 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, through these Bills, the farmer will be able to sell his produce even outside the ambit of the mandi, even outside his State at any price he chooses,” Mr. Tomar said.
Parliament has passed the three farm reform Bills — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill — in the session, which concluded on Wednesday. They will become laws after getting the assent of President Ram Nath Kovind and being notified."
106,"Amidst strong indications about the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani set to align with the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the faction has suffered a major blow with senior party leader and three time legislator Joseph M. Puthussery quitting the party to join the rival faction led by P.J. Joseph.
Announcing the decision here on Thursday, Mr. Puthussery told media persons that he wanted to follow the political probity of K.M. Mani and those who followed the footsteps of the KC(M) patriarch could never align with the LDF.
“Even though Mr. Mani had severed ties with the UDF in 2016, he then chose to come back soon,” he said.
He further criticised the Mani group's decision to forge ties with the LDF, which had made K.M. Mani a target of political witch hunt during the bar bribery case. “Ironically, those who claim the legacy of K.M. Mani are joining hands with the LDF after his demise. This is going to be suicidal. People who love K.M. Mani are not going to accept it,” Mr. Puthussery said.
The move comes close on the heels of reports that the faction had already given the LDF a list of local body wards from where it wished to contest in the upcoming local body elections.
Responding to the allegations levelled by the estranged leader, party general secretary Stephen George said the reasons cited by Mr. Puthussery to quit the party were nothing but the justification of a fortune seeker. “In fact, it is Mr. Puthussery, who has now taken a suicidal move as the camp he joined belonged to those who are trying to destroy the party founded by K.M. Mani,” Mr. George said.
Meanwhile, Mani group leader N. Jayaraj, MLA, said the party was yet to initiate a discussion with regard to joining the LDF."

109,"New caution boards have come up on either side of Mayor Muthu Road Over Bridge (ROB) warning heavy vehicles with more than 10 tonnes of weight to avoid the structure connecting Periyar bus stand with southern parts of Madurai city.
Reason: the bridge has lost its designed stability due to lack of proper maintenance. The bridge is a vital connectivity on the all-important Tirupparankundram Road providing the shortest link for southern districts to Madurai railway junction and Meenakshi temple.
In a bid to safeguard the “weak structure”, the Highways Department has put up another caution board restricting the speed limit on the bridge to 30 kmph.
A cursory glance shows that the sub-structure of the bridge is in bad shape what with the outer plastering worn out in every pillar. The iron rods have remained exposed to open air in too many spots for very long and are rusted. Even as the plastering has peeled off in many spots for more than half-a-foot, fresh cracks on the pillars reveal the stress the substructure is undergoing.
Every hour, hundreds of heavy vehicles, including buses, light vehicles and two-wheelers use the bridge under which Madurai-Manamadurai railway track runs.
“The bridge is more than 45 years old and needs urgent attention to retore it to its normal health,” says former Chief Engineer, State Highways Department, A.K. Rajaduraivelpandian.
It is not an isolated case of Mayor Muthu Bridge alone, but many structures of its age in the State are facing the same problem, he points out. “These are vey old bridges and routine maintenance like plastering and colour washing will not serve the purpose.”
The bridges should get special attention. “Advanced scientific solutions are available and concrete mix should be injected with advanced machineries to restore their stability,” Mr. Pandian says.
He recalls that he drew the attention of the State government several years ago to the need for special maintenance of bridges. However, that did not get any positive response till date. “Spending a few crores on maintenance will increase the longevity of the bridge by at least 10 to 20 years.”
If not attended to immediately or not done in the proper manner, the bridge might need total replacement. The State Highways should create a separate wing for maintenance of bridges on the lines of railways.“There is a telling difference in the maintenance of the railway portion of the bridges and the approach roads [maintained by the State Highways],” he adds.
A senior Highways official says a proposal for major maintenance work at a cost of ₹5 crore is pending with the State government. “The work will be taken up as per the advice of IIT-Madras. Once the reinforcement is done, it will gain its old stability.”
Traffic police have been advised to divert heavy vehicles through Ellis Nagar ROB, he adds."
110,"The National Domestic Workers Movement on Thursday called for special legislation to protect the welfare and livelihoods of the work force across the country.
Addressing mediapersons, along with a group of domestic workers, P. Clara, State coordinator, emphasised their plight in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and said the movement held protests across the country on Thursday.
Many workers lost their livelihoods since the outbreak of the pandemic, as they were falsely perceived to be carriers of the viral infection, said Ms. Clara. “Many of the domestic workers are sole breadwinners of their families. With the loss of livelihood, many are unable to pay their rent or make ends meet. Only a few have resumed work.”
Hence, the government must provide a financial aid of ₹7,500 for each month from April to December to withstand the financial crisis caused by the pandemic.
Condemning the passage of three key labour bills in Parliament, she said they would undermine the security and livelihood of unorganised workers. “The government must ensure that social security schemes can be availed by domestic workers too.”"

113,"The CBI searched the premises of half a dozen former officials of KITCO and that of an outreach wing of an institution on Thursday in connection with the probe into the alleged misappropriation of the agency's CSR funds and a few other contracts involving the agency.
The raids were conducted in Kochi and Kottayam and on the premises of former senior officials of KITCO which is headquartered in Kochi. This was in connection with the probe into instances of alleged misappropriation of CSR funds which, according to the case, either did not reach the intended beneficiaries or did not serve the purpose for which the money was meant for. Former MD of the agency Cyriac Davis is arraigned as first accused, said a CBI official who was part of the search team.
Both the Central and State governments have stake in the consultancy agency. Among the alleged cases of fund misappropriation was one in which the agency engaged an outreach wing of an institution to train women in the Kuttampuzha tribal belt in bee keeping and making value-added products from bamboo reeds.
An official, who was associated with the implementation of the initiative and had been questioned by the CBI earlier, said that the project to handhold a few dozen women was implemented in 2015. The local body too was involved in the project, he said.
The project ran into controversy after Forest Department officials, under whose area it was implemented, feigned ignorance of the initiative. An RTI activist had alleged that KITCO officials misappropriated the bulk of funds which were meant to empower tribal women.
A probe is also under way into the alleged irregularities in identifying KITCO's head office and alleged erroneous design of an effluent treatment plant at Cochin SEZ, which led to leakage, necessitating intervention of the State Pollution Control Board. Mr. Davis was unavailable for comment.
A VACB probe had revealed that the agency’s slack supervision led to cracks surfacing on Palarivattom flyover within two years of its commissioning, following which a senior official was remanded."

121,"In a first of its kind initiative in the country, gram panchayats under the Pune Zilla Parishad have pooled underutilised health fund money to purchase 92 ambulances and firm up the rural health infrastructure amid the rise in COVID-19 cases.
Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad, said this is probably the first instance where the rural administration of a district has taken the lead in buying ambulances since such purchases usually fall under the domain of the State government.
A sarpanch of a gram panchayat told The Hindu, “Under the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions, a portion of funds allotted to gram panchayats under the rubric of ‘health’ was lying unutilised. Often, the gram panchayats don’t know where to use their ‘health’ money and generally expend them in local-level sanitary works like repairing drainage systems.”
Mr. Prasad, in an innovative move, directed purchases of ambulances to be made under Section 139 of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959. “The gram panchayats passed resolutions and then pooled in their money, with each contributing their share as a proportion of their population. After obtaining a ‘technical’ sanction from the State government, we went ahead with the purchases, which were made over the one-stop Government e-Marketplace hosted by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals, where common user goods and services can be procured,” he said.
Each ambulance, a TATA Winger van purchased at ₹14.22 lakh, is equipped with two portable oxygen cylinders of 2.2 litre capacity, Global Positioning System, auto-loading stretcher facility and storage space for first aid and nursing kits. The driver’s remuneration and the cost of fuel are to be borne by the Zilla Parishad from its cess funds, authorities said.
Mr. Prasad said, “At present, 51 of these ambulances have been purchased. The remaining 41 will be procured next week. Of the 82 ambulances purchased by the State government, 41 were designated for rural areas. However, only 28 of these were equipped to ferry COVID-19 patients. The addition of 92 ambulances will be a tremendous boost to the healthcare system in rural parts.”
The move is expected to significantly firm up the healthcare infrastructure in Pune Rural, which has witnessed a dramatic surge in cases in the past three weeks. With an average daily case surge of nearly 1,000, the region has reported around 15,000 active cases and more than 1,200 deaths.
“Many a time, patients in far-flung areas lack easy access to multi-specialty hospitals. Moreover, ambulances are not fully equipped to cater to the urgent needs of critical patients. We hope to eliminate these problems with this new fleet of ambulances,” said Mr. Prasad.
Pune Zilla Parishad authorities said once the COVID-19 cases dwindle, the vehicles would be converted into 102 ambulances in a permanent augmentation of the Pune’s rural healthcare infrastructure
This isn’t the first time that the Pune Zilla Parishad has come up with a novel solution amid the COVID-19 crisis. In April, it came up with another out-of-the-box solution: placing errant spouses in institutional quarantine to counter rising cases of domestic violence during the lockdown."

123,"Bengaluru lad K.L. Rahul showed little concern for allegiance to home, dismantling Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) with a sparkling unbeaten century for Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday. Rahul’s 69-ball 132, laced with 14 fours and seven sixes, propelled KXIP to a comfortable 97-run victory.
KXIP amassed 206 for three in 20 overs before skittling out RCB for 109 in 17 overs.
Rahul, a former RCB player, was in full flow while recording his second IPL century. He got going with two crisp square-cuts off Dale Steyn, which pierced the tight off-side field. Umesh Yadav was not spared either, with Rahul launching into the fast bowler in the 10th over.
Yuzvendra Chahal was the pick of the bowlers once again, but when the leg-spinner strayed on the pads, Rahul unleashed the sweep to good effect. The 28-year-old cut loose in the last three overs, smashing five sixes and three fours.
Quite uncharacteristically, RCB skipper Virat Kohli dropped two sitters in the deep. Rahul, the beneficiary on both occasions, could hardly believe his luck. The KXIP skipper ended up scoring more than half of his team’s total.
The RCB pacers, meanwhile, made life easy for KXIP. Umesh sprayed it down the leg much too often, while Steyn bowled too short and wide. Even Navdeep Saini, the team’s standout pacer, could not maintain a good length and was punished.
The slide begins
RCB’s troubles continued in a poor chase. The side lost three wickets in the first three overs, including that of key man Kohli.
Opener Devdutt Padikkal, who had shown much promise in the previous match, was cramped for room by left-arm seamer Sheldon Cottrell. The lefthander’s awkward pull sliced to Ravi Bishnoi at mid-on.
Young Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Philippe was trapped on the pads by Mohammed Shami for a duck.
The wicket of Kohli (1, 5b), who was dismissed in similar fashion to Padikkal, spelt big trouble for RCB.
Not enough
Aaron Finch (20, 21b) and A.B. de Villiers (28, 18b) tried to repair the damage, but their 49-run stand was grossly inadequate.
The rest of the contest drudged along without much purpose, as RCB was well and truly out of it.
Leggies Bishnoi and M. Ashwin picked up three wickets each for KXIP.
The Punjab side notched up its first win in two matches, while the Bengaluru outfit was humbled after a sparkling start to its campaign a few days earlier.

TIRUCHI: Members of the Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee and other outfits staged protests in various places across the Central region on Thursday opposing the farm bills brought in by the Central Government and demanded immediate withdrawal. The protesting members burnt copies of the bills at different places to display their stiff opposition and raised slogans against the Centre and the State government.
The protests by various outfits were held at various locations in Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Perambalur, Pudukottai and Tiruvarur districts. In Tiruchi city, a group of about 55 members of the Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee staged a protest near the central bus stand where they burnt some copies of the bill. They were led by the Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam president M.P. Chinnadurai. The protesting members were arrested by the police.
The protests by the Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee members in Thanjavur district were held in Thanjavur Town, Sengipatti, Budalur and Melaulur. The stir held near the Thanjavur railway junction was led by the Tamizh Desiya Periyakkam town secretary L. Ramasamy during which they burnt the copies of the bills and raised slogans demanding their withdrawal. About 40 members of the Viduthalai Tamizh Puligal Katchi led by its founder Kudanthai Arasan staged a road roko against the bills and burnt the copies of the bills leading to their arrest.
A group of farmers affiliated to the Cauvery Vivasayigal Paadhugaapu Sangam led by its district secretary Sundara Vimalanathan staged a demonstration near the Kumbakonam Head Post Office in Thanjavur district during which they demanded the Centre to withdraw the bills as it would affect the agricultural community. In Orathanadu in Thanjavur district, a group of members of the Vivasaya Paadhukaapur Sangam affiliated to the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi staged a protest and raised slogans against the Centre and the State government.
The Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee members burnt copies of the bills as part of their protest at Mannargudi Town in Tiruvarur district. They alleged that the bills were aimed at supporting corporate houses and would affect the farming community. The protesters were led by the outfit's chief advisor Bharathiselvan. The functionaries of the Social Democratic Party of India resorted to protests on the same issue in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Thanjavur and in Tiruvarur.

127,"Thai lawmakers met Thursday to vote on six proposed amendments to the country’s military-backed constitution, as protesters pushing for charter reform gathered outside the Parliament building.
Changes to the constitution are one of three core demands that a coalition of protest groups has been seeking in recent months. The groups, which on Sunday held one of the biggest protest rallies in years, also want new elections and an end to intimidation of political activists, saying they are needed to strengthen democracy.
The protests, spearheaded by students, come as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s government faces broader criticism that it is ineffective and without direction as the economy sputters due to the knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government is also under pressure from some influential Thai royalists chagrined that the protesters are seeking unprecedented reforms to the monarchy, a sacrosanct institution to conservatives.
The current charter was written under the auspices of the military junta that took power after a 2014 coup and pushed it through in a referendum in which campaigning for a no vote was illegal. Prayuth led that coup, headed the military government and was named prime minister again after last year’s general election, held under the rules laid out by the new charter.
The constitution’s critics say its main aim was to secure the grip on power of the country’s traditional ruling elite - royalists, unelected bureaucrats and the military - by breaking that of political parties.
The constitution does not come from the people 100%, said Kanyakorn Suntornprug, a 20-year-old rallying outside Parliament. Even if in the past, it was not 100% democratic but at least there was some participation from the people.
The two-day debate on the amendments, which started Wednesday, is seen largely as an attempt to placate the protesters and ease pressure on the government. Voting by both houses of Parliament was expected to be completed late in the night.
While there is growing agreement that changes to the constitution are needed, there’s wide divergence over what those changes should be.
Key sections in dispute include the position and privileges of the monarchy - which protesters want to see redefined - and the role and powers of the unelected Senate.
The Senate’s 250 appointed members are seen as unequivocal backers of the present government and greatly influenced by the military. Most controversially, they are allowed to vote in the selection of a prime minister, a provision critics slam as fundamentally anti-democratic.
There are six proposals for charter amendment: one from Prime Minister Prayuth’s governing coalition and five from the opposition.
The one point both sides support is amending Section 256, which would establish a Constitution Drafting Assembly to write a new charter from scratch. The process could take as long as two years to complete.
However, it is unclear if enough senators would support the measure for it to pass, because voting on the amendments is conducted by a joint sitting of both houses. For any motion to pass it will need the support of at least a third of the senators, making victory uncertain even for the government’s draft supporting revision of Section 256.

131,"With the water level in the Idukki reservoir nearing the blue alert level on Thursday, a control room has been opened and arrangements made to monitor the situation.
Though rain has subsided, the inflow remained high with the water level in the dam reaching 2,387.04 ft. The blue alert level is 2,387.79 ft.
Though the present water level was below the rule curve level (2,395.79 ft) fixed by the Central Water Commission, the rise in the water level was attributed to the heavy rainfall two days back and low generation at the Moolamattom power house.
Usually, the generation level is lowered during the monsoon season.
According to the Dam Monitoring and Research Station at Vazhathoppe, the generation level was nearly 4.5 mu for the past three days. Though the water level is nearly 7 ft short of the red alert level, an official at the research station said the chances of opening the shutters of the reservoir were remote. The situation would change in the event of a heavy rainfall and power generation had to be raised to control the water level.
In case of an increase in water level, an orange alert will be sounded at 2,393.78 ft before the red alert at 2,394.79 ft. The full reservoir level is 2,404 ft.
Supriya S., KSEB chief engineer (Dam Safety and DRIP), on Thursday said the blue alert was marked as an internal alert system. “It is for advanced measures to be taken to prevent a sudden water release from a dam. With the rain subsiding, the inflow too will fall. The safety measures ensure the controlled release of water in case of a heavy rainfall,” she said.
Though the water level in the Pampa was flowing above the blue alert level, the inflow has come down on Thursday. At Kakki, the water level was much below the rule curve level, she added."

The police have registered an FIR and booked cases against 32 persons, including the father and the brother of the boy, for their alleged involvement in the case. However, the two were among the arrested seven persons.

Speaking at an all party meeting held here on Thursday he said that the political parties and the public forums could send representations to him to establish new polling booths. By taking into account of distance, terrain and other inconveniences, a decision will be taken. Necessary steps would be taken after inspecting the areas.

139,"Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi “God of farmers”, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said three farm sector reform bills passed recently by Parliament will double the income of cultivators.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday night, Mr. Chouhan termed those opposing the bills as “kisandrohi” (anti-farmers) and claimed they are doing so to protect the interest of middlemen.
“The Prime Minister, who is taking farsighted decisions, is God of farmers. All the three bills related to agriculture reforms are a blessing for farmers. These will double their income,” Mr. Chouhan said.
People opposing these bills are not well-wishers of farmers and are just misleading them, the BJP leader said.
“If any exporter, by paying a good price, purchases wheat and rice from farmers directly, then there will be no need for middlemen. Why are opposition parties supporting these middlemen?” he asked.
By crticising these bills, the opposition parties are not opposing the Prime Minister, but “blindly opposing” interests of farmers, the Chief Minister said.
The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 were passed in both the houses of Parliament amid protests from the opposition parties.
On Wednesday, 18 opposition parties urged President Ram Nath Kovind not to sign the contentious bills and alleged that they were passed “unconstitutionally” in “complete disregard” of parliamentary norms.
The Modi government has claimed these bills are to ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce without being subject to the regulations of mandis (agri markets).
Farmer organisations and the opposition parties allege that the law has been framed to suit “big corporates who seek to dominate the Indian food and agriculture business”, and will weaken the negotiating power of farmers."

They agreed to pay the amount a week after Sri Lanka’s Attorney General Dappula de Livera staked a claim of $1.8 million for the costs incurred on dousing the fire on board the Panama-registered tanker MT New Diamond on September 3.
Rajapaksa thanks defence personnel for fighting fire onboard MT New Diamond
New Diamond, a vessel under charter by the Indian Oil Corporation, was carrying 2,70,000 metric tonnes of crude oil from Mina Al Ahmadi port in Kuwait to the Indian port of Paradip when a boiler explosion in its engine room caused a fire off the coast of Sangamankanda in Ampara district.
A Filipino crew member died and another was injured in the incident. The Sri Lanka Navy with the help of Indian counterparts and coast guard doused the fire after great effort.
Sri Lankan navy plugs fuel leak on oil tanker
The New Diamond’s owners have told the Attorney General of their willingness to meet the interim claim. The Attorney General had ordered the police to record a statement from the captain of the ship.
The Colombo chief magistrate court later ordered the captain of the oil tanker to appear before the court on September 28.
He was to be charged for committing offences under the Marine Pollution Environmental Protection Act. The ship is currently in the seas 70 nautical miles east of Batticaloa in the east and 129 kilometres away from the Batticaloa coast. Two Sri Lankan Naval ships, one Indian Naval ship and three Indian coast guard vessels are currently deployed in the operations near the oil tanker.
Some five ships of Indian coast guard and one Indian Navy ship engaged in fire-fighting, the Sri Lanka Navy said early this month. The tanker had 23 crew members - 18 Filipinos and five Greeks. Twenty-two of the 23-member crew had been safely rescued off the tanker."
142,"Initial symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease happening due to the damaging of tissues that can lead to shortening of breath, have been noticed in a couple of people who recovered from COVID-19 here recently.
This was revealed by M. Shamsudeen, consultant physician attached to a Post-COVID Care Clinic at IQRAA Hospital in Kozhikode. The clinic has been set up jointly by the National Health Mission, Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, and the State government. The out-patient section here is open all days except Sunday from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
“The symptoms were found in two persons who came here for post-COVID check-up. One was in his 40s and the other in his 50s. Without losing time, they were given treatment. If they were late, it would have been difficult,” Dr. Shamsudeen said. He pointed out that fatigue, headache, body pain, breathlessness, and cough are some of the common after-effects found among those who had approached the clinic after recovering from COVID-19.
According to experts, almost 20% of people who got cured of the infection may develop future health problems. This includes asymptomatic people who were tested positive for the virus. It has been termed ‘post-COVID syndrome’ or ‘long COVID’. Paralysis, cardiac arrest, and epilepsy could be some of the consequences. Doctors at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences had earlier said that a majority of these patients might have conditions caused by other diseases. At least some of them may have to go for lung transplants, they had said.
Developed countries such as the United Kingdom has already begun ‘post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study’. It is a consortium of researches and clinicians from across that country “to understand and improve long-term health outcomes for patients who have been in hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.” In India, Delhi government is reported to have launched similar efforts.
Dr. Shamsudeen, however, noted that not many are aware of the importance of post-COVID care. “Those who have cough or breathing problems need to immediately seek medical treatment. Any negligence can be fatal,” he said. The clinic has three physicians and one pulmonologist."

145,"Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation’s new tourist attraction that faced hurdles over COVID-19 situation early this year is gearing up for a launch in Mysuru and Hampi, the State’s two major tourist destinations.
‘Ambari’, a specially-built double-decker bus for open-roof bus tours, is being launched in Mysuru during the low-key Dasara celebrations. The initiative's launch planned in March this year was put off in view of the pandemic.
With the festivities approaching, the KSTDC is now making preparations for rolling out the open-roof bus tours and ferrying tourists on the designated route to help them experience the beauty of Mysuru’s rich heritage on the go.
The KSTDC had requested the Forest Department and the Mysuru City Corporation to prune tree branches on the designated route for the smooth movement of the 16-ft.-tall bus.
The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation was also requested to raise its overhead electrical lines to facilitate hassle-free movement of the bus, and these works are expected to be done by Dasara. The 40-seater bus, with lower and upper decks, was built in Bengaluru.
KSTDC Regional Manager Uday Kumar told The Hindu that the CESC is expected to commence the work soon while the MCC and the Forest Department are already on the job. “All of them have assured us to get the things done soon so that we can start our trial run before we officially roll out the buses,” he added.
The COVID-19 situation had put brakes on the KSTDC’s plan of launching ‘Ambari’ in March this year and one such bus that arrived here from Bengaluru for the launch had to be parked in the KSTDC office premises awaiting the run.
Once the preparations are done for the launch, three other ‘Ambari’ buses are also expected to be operated depending on the prevailing situation and the response to the new attraction. Besides four ‘Ambari’ buses to Mysuru, two buses will be operated in Hampi.
“The route and other logistics are being worked out for the Hampi tour which may also take off this year,” he said.
Ambari is a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to experience the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists will get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages in the beginning — Kannada and English. Foreign languages will be added subsequently.
The body wrapping of ‘Ambari’ had been done based on the State’s art forms, culture and diversity, wildlife, and tourist destinations."
146,"Stating the three bills on agriculture passed in Parliament will benefit only corporate companies, Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK) general secretary E.R. Eswaran has said that implementation of the new laws will lead to more farmer suicides in the country.
In a press release, he said that Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, will affect small and marginal farmers.
They will be forced to enter into agreement with corporate companies and sell their produce at a price fixed by the companies. Small and marginal farmers cannot market their produce across the country and retail traders will benefit a lot. The release said that only companies can stock the farm produce which will ultimately lead to price control mechanisms falling under private hands.
“Attempts are made to project these laws will increase the income level of farmers which is untrue”, he said and added that the Centre should have consulted the State governments and farmers before introducing the bills. He said that the government had advertised that demonetisation and introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) had benefited the people. “But, there is no doubt that it had a negative impact on the people”, he added."
147,"Karnataka Legislative Assembly Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri on Thursday admitted a notice on no-confidence motion given by the principal Opposition Congress against the BJP government in Karnataka.
The Speaker informed the Assembly that he would allot time on Friday or Saturday for a discussion on the no-trust notice signed by 23 Congress members.
As soon as the House met after paying rich tributes to Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, who succumbed to COVID-19, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah raised the issue of notice on non-confidence motion and said the State government has lost confidence of the House and urged the Speaker to give a priority for debate on the no-trust motion.
“When the House has no confidence in the government, how will you continue”, Mr. Siddaramaiah said and demanded the Speaker to take up the no confidence motion discussion first before taking any other issues.
Countering the claims made by Mr. Siddaramaiah, Revenue Minister R Ashok said the Congress has no mandate in the state as well as in the country. “The notice on non-trust motion is nothing but political gimmick”, he said.
The government has majority and it was ready to prove majority in the House. But many members of the Congress already quit the party and many would quit soon. “We don’t know how many will remain in the Congress”, Mr. Ashok said.
When Mr. Askok stood up to table Bills, H K Patil (Congress) said the government should not be allowed to table bills after the Speaker admitted the notice on non-trust motion. Mr. Kageri termed Mr. Patil’s suggestion as his personal view and allowed Mr. Ashok table two bills in the House.
CLP meeting
Earlier, M.r Siddaramaiah chaired a meeting of the Congress Legislator’s Party (CLP) and decided to move the no-confidence motion against the government. He claimed that the government has lost people’s confidence and alleged that family members of Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa were indulged in corruption.
Speaking to mediapersons, the Congress leader alleged that the corruption was rampant in the purchase of equipment related to COVID-19 and purchase of laptops. There was no transparency in the administration. The Chief Minister’s son Vijendra has been interfering the administration. While the financial condition of the State has gone for a toss, the development works have come to a standstill in the State, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged.
D. K. Shivakumar, who is also the KPCC president, spoke about corruption in the government and said the party was serious in moving the no-trust vote against the government.
It is stated that AICC General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala suggested the state party leaders to move the no confidence motion against the government. On Wednesday, Mr. Surjewala alleged about corruption in the Yediyurappa government and sought the Chief Minister’s resignation."

151,"Following repeated incidents of man-elephant conflict in parts of Hassan district, the district-level officers of the Forest Department have written to the department seeking permission to radio-collar four more elephants and capture two problematic elephants. So far, four elephants have been radio-collared; however, equipment installed on three animals have stopped responding.
More than 60 elephants spread over four-five groups have been roaming around areas of Sakleshpur, Yeslur and Alur forest ranges of Hassan district. Every day, farmers complain to the Forest Department of crop damage due to the movement of the herds. A priest died on September 1 at Kollahalli near Sakleshpur, while he was near his house. Such incidents have forced the growers to put pressure on the State government demanding a permanent solution to the problem. They have urged the government to capture all elephants roaming in the area.
The rapid response teams formed by the Forest Department keep track of herds’ movement and alert local people so that man-elephant conflicts could be avoided. However, this exercise does not help in bringing down the instances of crop damage. The farmers cannot visit their farms for several days as the herds roam there. B.R. Manjunath, a planter at Ballupete, said the farmers had been losing patience over the repeated incidents of crop damage. “We don’t know how to protect our crops. If a coffee plant is lost due to elephants, the government pays ₹200 as compensation. But, we have spent years to grow it. How long the growers should tolerate this?”, he asked. Like him, many have conveyed their problems to the Forest Department.
Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu that he was aware of the problems faced by the growers. “We are doing what best can be done. Right now four elephants are radio-collared. We have to replace the batteries of three instruments. Besides that, I have written to the department to conduct an operation to radio-collar four more. Once it is done, we will be tracking the movement of eight elephants so that location of herds could be tracked easily”, he said.
Similarly, the department has also identified two elephants for capture and relocation. “Considering their behaviour, we have identified two tuskers for capture. The operation will be done once rains stop”, he added."
152,"Gupteshwar Pandey, the tough-talking IPS officer who stepped down as Bihar police chief late Tuesday night, hogged media limelight a day after and dropped hints about joining politics, asserting he is a “free man” now and that contesting elections is not illegal.
The voluble former top cop of the state was chased and courted by national television through the day but what they succeeded in wangling out of him for now was that he is still not a political person, but being a “free man” now, he could join politics if people want him to do so.
“I am now a free citizen of India like you. I am no longer the DGP. So, no service rules apply to me anymore.
Thousands of people are coming from Buxar, Begusarai, Jehanabad, Aurangabad and other districts. I will take a decision after talking to them. Contesting elections is not illegal,” he told journalists.
The assertive officer is often called ‘Robinhood Pandey’ by his band of supporters.
Mr. Pandey, who had come in for criticism from politicians in Maharashtra for strongly pleading for a CBI probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, however, said he was “exasperated” at suggestions that he did so because of his political ambitions.
“I have spent more than three decades in (police) service and nobody can raise a finger at my professional integrity. But, in the recent past, thousands of calls and messages seeking to know when I am entering politics, which party I am planning to join.....left me exasperated,” Mr. Pandey said.
When journalists persisted with questions about whether he has plans to join politics, he said, “I have neither joined any political party nor I am a political person till now. When I join (a party), I will tell all of you before I do.
“Politics is not the only way of serving society. One can work for society in different ways even without joining politics.”
Mr. Pandey, a daring IPS officer known for his rustic mannerisms, had sought voluntary retirement in 2009 amid speculation that he wanted to contest the Lok Sabha election from Buxar. It was rumoured that the BJP wanted to field him from the seat which has substantial Brahmin votes.
The saffron party changed its mind and did not field Mr. Pandey.
In a rare concession by a state government for an IPS officer who had voluntarily quit service, the ruling dispensation in Bihar sat over his resignation for nine months and then reinstated him.
The officer, at whose suggestion, the Bihar government had recommended a CBI probe into the death of Patna-born actor Sushant Singh Rajput in Mumbai, rubbished suggestions that his outspokenness in the case was in anyway linked to his political ambitions.
The officer had virtually waged an all-out war with Maharashtra politicians on national television in support of a CBI investigation in Rajput’s death case, asserting that it alone could do “justice” to the deceased actor.
In line of Shiv Sena fire, Mr. Pandey, who has a fan following among a section of the youth in Bihar, was unflappable, and declared he will do everything to get the actor justice.
The VRS request of Mr. Pandey, who would have retired in February 2021, was accepted by Governor Phagu Chauhan on Tuesday, the day he tendered his resignation.
“The Bihar DGP who was used for this defamation is being blatantly rewarded. His voluntary retirement says it all,” said Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant in Mumbai, reacting to reports that Pandey could take the political plunge.
While a government officer has to give three months’ notice before resigning, Mr. Pandey’s resignation was accepted immediately, he said.
Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut, with whom Mr. Pandey had locked horns over the issue of a CBI probe in Rajput’s death case, also claimed the former Bihar DGP was being “rewarded” for speaking against Mumbai and Maharashtra.
Mr. Pandey, who had said actress Rhea Chakraborth had no ’aukaat’ (stature) to comment on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s decision to recommend a CBI probe in the case, defended his statement.
“Someone who is an accused in the case and named in an FIR for hatching a conspiracy to kill Sushant Singh Rajput has no right to make any comment against a person who is occupying a constitutional post,” Mr. Pandey said.
Bihar’s ruling JD(U) preferred silence on Mr. Pandey seeking voluntary retirement or his political ambition, ally BJP said everyone has the right to lead a social and political life in a democratic set up.
“Gupteshwar Pandey jee had joined the service on his own sweet will and has now opted for VRS. There is no scope left for a political party to make any suggestion about what he should do. He has every right to choose a political party or ideology he wants to pursue,” state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said."

156,"A political slugfest appears to be on the cards as the Bharatiya Janata Party government in the State has tabled an eight-and-half-year-old report on the “misuse and encroachment” of Wakf properties before the State legislature.
The report. readied on March 23, 2012, by the then chairman of the Karnataka State Minorities Commission Anwar Manippady has kicked up political dust afresh as it names several prominent politicians, particularly those in the Congress, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Dharam Singh, Rehman Khan, Jaffer Sharief, MLAs Khaneer Fathima Qamur-ul-Islam, N.A. Haris, his wife Tahera Haris and mother Suraiah Mohammed, as those among the ones responsible for “misuse and encroachment” of Wakf properties.
Others who have been named in the report include MLA Roshan Baig, former Union Minister C. Ibrahim, former Ministers Qamur-ul-Islam and Hindasgeri, former MP Narasing Rao Suryavamshi and former MLAs Iqbal Ansari and Syed Yasin.
The tabling coincides with the Opposition mounting its attack on the government over several issues including the charges of corruption and improper handling of the COVID-19 situation.
The report, which has listed encroachment as well as misuse of properties in each of the districts, says that 1,803 acres of the total 2,586 acres in Bidar alone have been encroached.
The report has described the “massive” encroachment and misappropriation as “only the tip of the iceberg.” Alleging that “Wakf mafia” has joined hands with Wakf Board in the scam, it has observed that the volume of the scam is not smaller than 2-G scam that rocked the country earlier.
It has recommended to the government to take the Wakf Board into its control and begin the task of cleansing it. It has recommended that an inquiry should be conducted through the Lokayukta besides initiating legal process by suspending the Wakf Committee for a year.

159,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday took suo moto cognizance of the building collapse in Bhiwandi in Thane and said, “it is a very serious incident”, where 41 were declared dead and 25 rescued by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).
A Division Bench of Chief Justice (CJ) Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni was hearing a matte related to a construction in Kalyan Dombivali and the CJ remarked, the incident in Bhiwandi was very serious.
The 43-year-old Jilani building in the powerloom town is around 10 km from Thane. The three-storey structure had 40 flats and 150 people were living there.
The court said, “A building has collapsed in Bhiwandi, several lives have been lost. We are told the situation is quite serious in Mumbai too.”
Taking suo moto cognizance of the same, the court made the State of Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and the civic bodies of Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Kalyan-Dombivali, Thane and Navi Mumbai as respondents in the case.
Serves notice 
The court issued notices to the State and all municipal corporations and directed Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to ensure that all the parties file their reply in two weeks.
Mr. Kumbhakoni said, “We will file our replies detailing what has been done so far across the State for such buildings and measures taken, as well as the steps we propose to take in future.”

“A part of the collection is called Lounge Away and has been designed keeping in mind the current period. We believe fashion has to adapt to the changing times and our latest collection embodies elegance and functionality,” says Abraham, adding, “We felt it was important for our clients to know the line was something they could enjoy, even though our lives have changed so much in the past few months.”
“Ffolio will be the main destination for our collection in Bengaluru,” adds Abraham.
“I believe Abraham & Thakore are one of India’s leading designers right now as they have understood the importance of using Indian textiles and techniques to create a global product,” says stylist and choreographer Prasad Bidapa who will be launching the collection along with Yashodhara Shroff, founder of Ffolio. “That is the way ahead for handloom and khadi in our country as designers utilise them to generate employment and establish prosperity across the board.”
“The move to a more central location as well as to a landmark store in the city is an important one for Abraham & Thakore,” says Bidapa, who will be styling a couple of ladies in various looks with the outfits from the collection at the event. “The clothes, which are handmade are beautiful with hand-finished embroidery on textiles that celebrate what India is all about.”
Abraham & Thakore wil be launched at Ffolio, 5. Vittal Mallya Road on September 26 between 12 noon and 2 pm."

Advocate Pradeep Thorat, for Mr. Raut, and senior advocate Anil Sakhare, appearing for Mr. Late, sought time before a Division Bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla to file their replies.
Mr. Thorat said he needed time to file an affidavit as Mr. Raut, being an MP, is in Delhi. The Bench, however, made a remark on the BMC seeking time to reply. “You need more time here but otherwise you are very fast [in demolishing],” it said.
While allowing them time to do so, the court said, “since 40% of the Petitioner’s [Ms. Ranaut] Bungalow is already demolished on 9th September, 2020 and the Bungalow continues to stand in partially demolished condition since then, it is likely that some mishap may be caused due to the heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest.”
The Bench thus directed senior advocate Birendra Saraf, representing the actor, to commence his arguments on September 25 at 3 p.m.
On September 9, the BMC undertook a drive to demolish the alleged illegal portions of Ms. Ranaut’s office. Soon thereafter, the court directed the BMC to stay the process of demolition.
A ‘stop work’ notice was issued by the BMC on September 8 under Section 354A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act (power of Designated Officer to stop erection of building or work commenced or carried on unlawfully) was issued to Ms. Ranaut on September 8 pertaining to substantial alterations and additions carried out unlawfully."
