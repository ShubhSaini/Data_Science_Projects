0,"“I sing the notes as they are written but it is the Almighty who comes out as my voice,” was a frequent statement made by S.P. Balasubrahmanyam. His first recorded song was from the film Shanti Nilayam, produced by Gemini Vasan, and the script work was done by me. Englishman Marcus Bartley was the cameraman.
M.S. Viswanathan had tuned a song Iyarkaii Ennum Ilaiyya Kanni and a few months earlier, SPB had frequented his house seeking an opportunity to sing in films. “Get rid of your Telugu accent and improve your Tamil!” MSV told him, and within months, SPB’s Tamil improved. MSV made him sing Iyarkaii Ennum Ilaiyya Kanni and it was an instant hit. He received ₹150 as remuneration for the song.
Meanwhile, MGR had an issue with T.M. Soundararajan, and SPB had the opportunity to sing for him — the song Ayiram Nilave Vaa in Adimai Penn. Though Adimai Penn released first, SPB’s first recorded song was from Shanti Nilayam.
SPB loved working with our Chithralaya Unit and before singing Panivizhum Malarvanam, he prostrated in front of Sridhar and me, and said, “Gopu sir, Chithralayaa is my mother’s home.”
His divine voice and singing talent apart, Baalu, as we fondly called him, was a perfect gentleman who respected the seniors and encouraged youngsters. His death is a personal loss to me, and the film industry will not be the same again.
The void SPB has left behind will remain empty for long."

2,"Listening to legendary singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam perform on stage was a musical delight. Stage shows were an integral part of his music journey and he never stepped onto a stage without rehearsals.
With his incredible versatility, he rendered songs on stage with utmost precision and nurtured budding talent. Organisers of various orchestras who have performed with him for decades recall Balasubrahmanyam as a dedicated singer who respected his co-singers, irrespective of their age.
Recalling that a fund-raiser concert for his hotel management college in 1969 was one of SPB’s early shows, Abaswaram Ramjhi, who has a children’s music troupe Issai Mazhalai, said: “He later sang at my wedding, along with the Pavalar Brothers troupe, in 1977.”
To the organisers of musical orchestras, he was a down-to-earth singer who never missed an opportunity to appreciate singers and musicians. Describing him as a multi-tasker, V. Lakshmanan, one of the founders of Lakshman Sruthi orchestra, said that during a show in Australia, the audience gave a standing ovation for his rendition of song Kadavul amaithu veitha medai that involved a lot of mimicry.
“He introduced me as a mimicry artiste to the audience and gave 20 minutes to perform and I too got a standing ovation. I have marvelled at his ability to do several things simultaneously. Each of the 300 shows we have done with him is a learning experience in nuances in singing. He always advised young singers to never mimic him and focus on the uniqueness of their voice.”
Organisers also recall SPB to be a jovial person who subtly suggested corrections to singers or musicians without hurting them. S. Sankarram, founder of Saadhaga Paravaigal troupe, noted that he was a perfectionist who was particular about language and pronunciation. “He was one of those rare singers who never needed the help of audio technology and could bring in the same feel of playback singing in live shows too. He always insisted on bhaavam to render the right emotions. He was gifted with a youthful, mellifluous voice and sang in the original pitch of the songs till his last breath,” he said.
SPB has helped several musicians throughout his career, said Karthik Jayaraman of Abbas Culturals, one of the many troupes associated with him for over three decades. He has performed Naanum Kamalum for nine years as a tribute to actor Kamal Haasan, and Kalai Vizha was one his last shows in January. He used to rehearse even during breaks in between performances on stage.
Members of the Tamil Nadu Medai Melisai Kalaingargal Sangam, Madurai, organised a live show at Arapalayam on Friday night to pay homage to the singer.
J. B. Vijay, organiser of Tarangini orchestra and the association’s president, said the loss of SPB was a bigger blow to many orchestra singers than the loss of livelihood due to the lockdown. “There is denial among the community about his death as it touched our hearts. Our rendition of his songs has brought us applause on all stages, be it wedding halls, temple festivals or other functions,” he said.
S. Mathiazhagan, who runs Navarasam Isaikulam in Madurai, attributes his personal uplift to SPB and said his voice allowed light music troupes to earn a living."
3,"Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) chief Raju Shetti on Friday reiterated his firm opposition to the Centre’s farm Bills and said destroying the system of agricultural produce market committees (APMC) and replacing it with contract farming did not guarantee that farmers would not be exploited.
Speaking in Kolhapur, Mr. Shetti said he is willing to support the Bills only if Prime Minister Modi announces a minimum support price (MSP) for farmers to cushion them from natural calamities and volatile market changes. .
“The Centre must understand that our protest is not merely a political agitation. We are upset as there is a sinister intent behind passing these three Bills, which the Modi government could do so only on the strength of a brute majority,” said Mr. Shetti, who burnt copies of the Bills while his party workers staged protests across Maharashtra.
Mr. Shetti said his mentor, the late farmer leader Sharad Joshi, had spoken in support of an open economy in agriculture. “Sharad Joshi had said market committees had become the abattoirs of these farmers. I, too, support this view. But while there is no doubt that today’s market committees are exploiting farmers, destroying one system and bringing in another does not mean that farmers will not be exploited.”
He said around 30% of the total foodgrains produced in the country are procured by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (NAFED) and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) through APMCs. He said, “The Centre purchases agricultural commodities with a minimum guarantee. That is their responsibility. It acts as a base for farmers.” He added that the Modi government had formed the Shanta Kumar Committee to study this minimum guarantee that was the right of the farmer.
However, the Shanta Kumar Committee had recommended the Centre to stop this guarantee and cease supply of cheap foodgrains through the public distribution system (PDS). “It is in line with these recommendations that the Bills have been passed in Parliament. One cannot rule out that the Centre, in the near future, will remove the organs for food procurement and leave the poor to fend for themselves,” said Mr. Shetti.
Remarking that the market operated on the cold principle of supply and demand, not on emotion, Mr. Shetti said farmers are worried about what would happen to their MSP once the corporates took over. He said, “Farmers in Maharashtra have not been hit hard yet. So, there is relative peace here. But in Bihar, farmers are selling maize at ₹1,100 per quintal even though the guaranteed price is ₹1,850 per quintal. Who is responsible for this?” Mr. Shetti said there was widespread anxiety that the FCI and NAFED would be sold to corporates.
“The worrying part is that the Modi government has taken out State-owned companies for sale, citing losses. Air India is a good example of this. FCI and NAFED will be in the line for sale sooner or later. If that happens, then an Adani or an Ambani will be ready to buy it. This will spell the death knell of the average farmer who will entirely be at the mercy of the corporates,” Mr. Shetti said.
Cautioning the Centre, he said as there would be no restrictions to bind corporates, the companies were free to reject ‘bad’ agricultural products or even brand products as ‘bad’, thereby buying them at a lower price from farmers. “With the passage of these Bills, companies will now compete to buy agricultural produce from farmers. Private companies are not bound to guarantee good prices to farmers. History has shown that when prices are good, contracts are deliberately broken, citing quality, grading reasons,” said Mr. Shetti.
Given that 80% farmers in India are smallholders, Mr. Shetti said they were extremely vulnerable to corporate exploitation. “No expert is needed to predict the outcome if a small farmer, thus cheated, decides to sue a company with a turnover of thousands of crores in the High Court,” he said."
4,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis on Friday said not implementing the farm Bills in Maharashtra would mean nothing less than a betrayal of farmers.
“Every State government will have to implement the laws passed by the Centre. Otherwise, it will be nothing but a betrayal of farmers,” said Mr. Fadnavis. He said it was the Congress that had included these Bills in its 2019 election manifesto.
“If the Congress had itself included these Bills in its manifesto, then how can the party oppose it now? The party should have said that it would implement the Bills if it comes to power and oppose them if another party comes to power,” he said.
Congress leader H.K. Patil, who is on his first visit to the State after being appointed Maharashtra in-charge, said the party will continue to oppose the Bills till they are withdrawn. “This is nothing but lies by the BJP that these Bills were part of the Congress manifesto. We never promised such draconian laws,” he said.
The Maharashtra Congress is starting a month-long online campaign against the Bills from Saturday. On Monday, Congress leaders will be meeting Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to hand over a memorandum, demanding the withdrawal of the Bills. The party will also observe October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, as Kisan Majdoor Bachao Divas and launch a month-long signature campaign.
On the declaration of polling dates in Bihar, Mr. Fadnavis, who is the BJP’s co-in-charge in the State, said, “The people of this country and of Bihar stand with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The people of Bihar trust the leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modiji. The BJP-JDU alliance will win a massive majority in Bihar.”"
5,"Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday clarified that the Maharashtra government had no plans of implementing the contentious farmer and labour Bills passed by the Narendra Modi-led Central government.
Mr. Pawar’s statement in Pune came in the backdrop of protesting farmer outfits, who demonstrated against the Bills as part of the shutdown called by the Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Samanvay Samiti. “What was the need [of the Modi government] to pass these Bills in such a hurry? They do not seem to be beneficial to farmers. Several farmer outfits across the country have vehemently opposed them. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), along with several other political parties, are strongly opposed to it as well,” said Mr. Pawar, speaking on the sidelines of a COVID-19 review meeting in the city.
He said while the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was currently studying the legalities, the fact that they were pushed through Parliament cast aspersions on whether they would ultimately be beneficial to farmers.
Growing opposition
Farmer outfits, including the Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) and the All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), staged protests across the State, burning copies of the Bills while raising slogans against the Modi-led government.
Protests were prominent in Kolhapur and Buldhana – both strongholds of the SSS, as well as Nanded, Jalna and Ahmednagar. “The AIKS has staged protests in 21 districts of Maharashtra on Friday. We have made a bonfire of the Bills and protested in front of tehsil and Collector offices while staging rasta roko. It is heartening to see that the ruling parties, the NCP, the Shiv Sena and the Congress are also participating wholeheartedly in these protests,” said Ajit Nawale, State Secretary, AIKS.
Dr. Nawale said the Centre had cleverly couched the Bills as a means of ‘freeing’ the farmers from the exploitative practices of the agricultural committees.
“However, in reality, the Centre is washing its hands of its responsibility of looking after the welfare of farmers by subjecting them to the whims of the corporates,” he said, adding that under these Bills, market committees are to be dismantled, which will thereby destroy the system of guaranteed prices to farmers."
6,"Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has no qualms in admitting that he has missed injured Ambati Rayudu badly in the last two games, and said that the three-time champions are “lacking a bit of steam” in their batting unit in the ongoing Indian Premier League.
Rayudu played a brilliant 48-ball 71-run knock in CSK’s five-wicket win over defending champions Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener but the right-hander has been on the sidelines in the last two matches owing to a hamstring injury.
But Dhoni expressed hope that Rayudu will be available in their next game, which according to him will provide much-needed balance to the side.
“I don’t think it was a good game for us. There was no dew, but the wicket did slow down. We are lacking a bit of steam in the batting and that hurts. The run rate keeps on mounting after such slow starts and adds pressure, we need to figure that out.
“We need to come back with a clearer picture, looking at the combination. Maybe, the team balance will get better once Rayudu comes back in the next game,” Dhoni said after losing by 44 runs to Delhi Capitals on Friday.
“That will give us the room to experiment with an extra bowler perhaps. There are quite a few things we can think about. We are one batter extra to start off, so the players need to step up.”
The veteran skipper also asked his bowlers to pull up their socks after two ordinary outings.
“We need to get better with our lengths, lines and pace. I think the spinners have not come to the party yet. We are bowling good deliveries, but we are giving away the boundary deliveries bit too often,” he said.
Barring some fielding lapses, Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer is happy with the performance of his side so far.
“I am really happy with the performance. I would give them the benefit of doubt, is tough to catch in these conditions. You misjudge the ball, really don’t know how to pace yourself,” he said.
“In the team meeting we decided that we are going to assess the batting conditions early and then play accordingly. The way the openers started gave us a lot of confidence and the finish was good too. I am lucky to have KG (Rabada) and Nortje in the team. It’s important to stick together as a team and we need to enjoy each other’s success.”"
7,"Climbing trees, plucking mangoes, going to each other’s house in their native village Konetampettai. These are some of the memories that remain afresh in the mind of P. Subramani alias Chittamutti, the childhood friend of S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, fondly called as Mani in his village.
“We went around the village together. Mani’s mother Shakuntala, known as Chinnama, used to call me Chittamutti, and the entire village knows me by that name now. He was loved by everyone in the hamlet. He bore my daughter’s medical expenses,” recalls Mr. Subramani, who still lives at Konetampettai.
A pall of gloom descended upon Konetampettai, the native village of SPB’s mother. “He was from a Brahmin family and we are from the ST community. But his family was very close to us. We met him when he came to our village a few years ago,” says Jayamma, Mr. Subramani’s daughter-in-law.
The entire village recalls him as humble and friendly, and a person who never forgot his roots. “He used to ask about every detail of the hamlet. Our families are very close. There is no caste divide in our hamlet,” says Rajendra Prasad, who identified himself as SPB’s family friend.
He recalls that whenever villagers went to invite him to the hamlet for a function, he would ask what he should do for the village. “His last visit was in August 2018 and he helped build toilets for the school and a RO plant. He was punctual. The entire village is sad to have lost him. Many have been crying since Thursday night. We can never meet such a person,” he says.
A. Bhanumurthy, SPB’s cousin, says they were like Arjuna and Krishna. “The last time I spoke to him was on September 12. I asked him when he was getting discharged and he said he was feeling better,” he recalls. He says his cousin could never hurt anybody, even if it was his enemy. “He will mingle with everyone, right from the Prime Minister to an ordinary man.”
An ardent lover of cricket, tennis and reading, SPB was a keen observer too. “He was an authority in Telugu pronunciation. He could sing in any language. He had always showed the keenness and dedication of a student... He wanted to rebuild his house in the village and even approved the plan,” he adds.
His loss has left many speechless. “All the music lovers are in tears. We have lost a great person. Our village will miss him very much,” says Mr. Rajendra Prasad."
8,"Governor Banwarilal Purohit and leaders cutting across party lines condoled the death of singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam on Friday.
“He was a nice gentleman who spent his life in music and playback singing. His demise is an irreparable loss to the people of India, and particularly music lovers across the globe. All of us will miss his magical golden voice. However, he will always remain with us through his melodious voice and eternal music compositions,” Mr. Purohit said in his condolence message.
Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said people were hoping that he would recover and the news of his death had come as a shock.
DMK president M.K. Stalin said the news of Mr. Balasubrahmanyam’s demise was hard to digest. He said COVID-19 had taken away an extraordinary singer. “It is a great loss for the music world and crores of his fans, including me. I consider this a personal loss. His songs and sweet voice will always remain with us,” Mr. Stalin added.
Congress leader P. Chidambaram said the music and film industry had lost a great artiste. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the singer’s death was an irreparable loss to the country. “He attracted crores of followers through his singing and it is a big loss to India, and especially his fans from Tamil Nadu,” Mr. Alagiri said. He also wondered if there could be another singer like him and whether the void left by his death could ever be filled by another.
Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, PMK founder S. Ramadoss and youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss, MDMK chief Vaiko, TMC leader G.K. Vasan, AMMK founder T.T.V. Dhinakaran, DMK general secretary Duraimurugan, Congress MP Su. Thirunavukkarasar, CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan, VCK founder Thol. Thirumavalavan, BJP State president L. Murugan and Samathuva Makkal Katchi founder R. Sarathkumar extended their condolences.
Prince of Arcot Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ali said a melodious voice would be missed, but his songs would be played over and over again, for a long time to come. It would be difficult to fill the vacuum left by SPB, he said."
9,"The Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court recently issued a notice to the State government after a plea sought benefits under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana for all COVID-19 patients and not just for those on ventilators.
A Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Om Prakash Shete, the former head of the Chief Minister’s Medical Assistance Cell, on September 7.
It stated that the government through a GR on August 4, 2016, introduced the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, which provided free medical treatment to people below poverty the line, beneficiaries under the Annapurna scheme, orange and yellow ration card holders, farmers from 14 suicide-prone districts, students from government residential schools, senior citizens and women from shelter homes and orphanages, and journalists and their families.
The plea said, “Due to the highest number of COVID 19 patients, there are no beds/space in government hospitals. On May 23, 2020, there was a government resolution, where the State included COVID-19 patients under the scheme. The category pertains to COVID-19 situation included in Schedule ‘A’, which is limited only to patients with critical care i.e. with ventilator assistance and other life support systems. When common COVID-19 patients, who are otherwise eligible as beneficiaries under the scheme, approached an empanelled hospital, they were not bestowed with the benefits of the scheme.”
The plea said the “non-application of mind of authorities and non-inclusion of all COVID-19 patients” led to common people requiring to pay huge medical bills at private hospitals. The reason they get admitted to private hospitals is the lack of availability of beds in government hospitals.
The PIL sought a direction to the State to provide free medical aid to COVID-19 patients at private hospitals under the scheme.
The court has posted the matter for further hearing on September 30."
10,"Senior advocate Birendra Saraf, representing Kangana Ranaut, on Friday told a Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathwalla and R.I. Chagla in the Bombay High Court that the photographs submitted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) weakens its case against the actor.
Mr. Saraf said, “Demolishing of her bungalow is a case where all laws and provisions have been thrown out.” He said the act of demolishing alleged illegal alterations in the actor’s bungalow at Pali Hill in Bandra was a “malafide action as my client had a difference of opinion and ideology with those in power”. Mr. Saraf said the timing of the action by the corporation “supports my case and clearly shows that there is malice in fact and law on the part of the civic body authorities”.
He added, “Ms. Ranaut is at loggerheads with the Maharashtra government over some issues. She has displeased a party in power with her open views. She had to face death threats and seek special protection from the Centre. [Shiv Sena MP] Sanjay Raut has made derogatory statements against Kangana on TV channels. He said Kangana needs to be taught a lesson. On the same day that Mr. Raut made the remarks, an officer from the BMC visited the property and entered it without prior notice. The timing of the visit assumes relevance.”
On Friday, Bhagyavant Late, the designated officer of H West ward, filed a rejoinder with photos of the office at the actor’s bungalow. Mr. Late said the photographs showed unauthorised construction. The 58-page document said, “The petitioner [Ms. Ranaut] was carrying out extensive work on her premises [with six workmen] and had made substantial alterations and additions contrary to the approved building plan. Action under Section 354 A (power of designated officer to stop erection of building or work commenced or carried on unlawfully) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act was fully justified and allegations of malafides in law are unwarranted and false.”
It added, “The first inspection report recorded the presence of workmen and work going on in the said property and bags filled with construction waste, but contained no details of the ongoing work. Based on the report, an inspection was carried out on September 7 and it was found that unlawful additions and alterations had been carried out contrary to the sanctioned building plans.”
Mr. Saraf argued for two hours and will continue with his arguments on Monday."

15,"The Jail Department authorities were left with egg on their face after an accused managed to flee the detention centre at Karukutty near Angamaly for the second consecutive time in as many nights.
Suresh aka Dracula Suresh, 30, of Vadayambady, nicknamed for his ability to pull off thefts and robberies under the cover of night, was the one to flee the detention centre in the early hours of Friday. Another accused, Mishal, 22, of Thalasserry also managed to escape along with him.
All arrested persons are kept at the detention centre till their COVID-19 test results are out, and only those testing negative are moved into jails.
Suresh was nabbed from a house at Vengola near Perumbavoor and brought to the detention centre on Thursday after he had escaped when he was first brought to the centre the previous night. He had then taken to his heels the moment he was freed from a handcuff that was fastened to his wrist along with that of another accused.
He, along with Mishal, was locked up in a room on the second floor of the detention centre on Thursday night. However, they somehow managed to break the lock and climb down through an adjacent tree bent over the second floor, sometime between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. on Friday.
It is learnt that Suresh had been to the detention centre at least on four occasions in connection with different cases, and that familiarisation probably helped him flee twice.
Suresh was arrested last week on the charge of looting a shop at Perumbavoor. He has over 20 cases against him in Kochi city and Alappuzha, Idukki and Thrissur districts.
According to the police, he was habitually violent and attacked the police whenever he was arrested. He had allegedly attempted to escape police custody even in the past and even resorted to self-harm as a ploy.
Mishal was arrested in connection with a motorcycle theft case by the Elamakkara police. He is also an accused in a sexual abuse case in Thalassery, the police said.
District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik on Friday visited the police detention centre in the wake of two successive incidents of security breaches.

The farmers’ wing of the Trinamool Congress held a protest near Gandhi Statue on Esplanade by dislaying farm produce. Senior Trinamool Congress leaders including Tapas Roy and head of party’s farmers’ wing Bechram Manna were present at the protest venue and promised the farmers that the State government would protect the interest of farmers. This was the third day of protests by the Trinamool Congress over the passage of the farm Bills.
According to the State unit of All India Kishan Mahasabha, protests were held across 200 places in West Bengal, where farmers blocked national and State highways. Protestors blocked the National Highway at Debra and Chandrakona in Paschim Medinipur, Karjorain Paschim Bardhaman, Gazole in Malda and Tufanganj in Cooch Behar districts respectively.
Protesters also blocked the State Highway in Bankura and Murshidabad district. The blockade on the major arterial roads lasted from 11 a.m. to 12 noon and from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
“The protest in West Bengal witnessed spontaneous protests by a large number of farmers. Despite inclement weather and rains the National and State highways were blocked at several places,” Amal Halder, secretary of West Bengal unit of All India Krishak Sabha, the peasant wing of Communist Party of India (Marxist) told The Hindu. Mr. Halder said nearly two lakh farmers and agricultural workers participated in the protests.
The Paschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity (PBKMS), an organisation of agricultural workers who have supported the farmers strike, also held protests in South 24 Parganas. “The interest of agricultural workers is intertwined with farmers. Along with this for farm labourers it is also a question of food security,” said Anuradha Talwar of PBKMS.
Later in the evening leaders of the Congress and Left parties held a joint rally in the city in which hundreds of people joined in. The protest rally began at Esplanade and concluded at Shyambzar.

He says private traders buy the produce at a much lower price than the MSP.
In the upcoming Rabi (winter) season, Shingara is hoping to get a remunerative price for his wheat crop. In Punjab and Haryana, the Central government purchases wheat and paddy (rice) at the MSP, which gives farmers an assured market and return. But Shingara is worried that following the passage of the farm bills in Parliament last week, even wheat and paddy will face the same fate that crops that are not purchased by the government agencies of the State or the Centre face.
The Hindu Explains | Why are the Agriculture Bills being opposed
The Central government says the three bills — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill — are aimed at transforming agriculture in the country and raising farmers’ income. The provisions of the bills, it says, will enable barrier-free trade in agricultural produce and empower farmers to engage with investors of their choice.
‘I can’t trust private players’
But farmers are not convinced by the government’s promises. In both Punjab and Haryana, farmers are up in arms against the three farm bills. They fear that they are a step towards abolition of the MSP regime, leaving farmers to suffer possible exploitation at the hands of big corporate houses. And the fear is not limited to any one group of farmers; it is shared by marginal, small and large/ other farmers. While marginal farmers (those cultivating up to two and a half acres of land) and small farmers (those cultivating up to five acres) fear that they will be completely pushed out of agriculture, large farmers (cultivating over five acres) feel they may be able to ride it out for a few years, but will eventually find it difficult to stand up to multinational corporations and big traders.
Shingara is wary of dealing with private companies. His fear is rooted in his experience of trading with a company. He started sowing barley crop around eight years ago after a liquor manufacturing company near his village offered to buy his crop. “The company makes beer. People from the company came to our village and wanted us farmers to cultivate barley. They said the company would purchase our produce at a higher price than the MSP. Initially, for two-three years, they did pay us ₹400 above the MSP. But later, when several farmers started sowing the crop and supply increased, they were reluctant to buy the produce at that assured price. On the pretext of quality, they either rejected the produce or paid us a lower price. After 2015-16, I stopped cultivating barley,” he says.
Comment | Will the farm bills benefit farmers?
Dilbag Singh, 44, another farmer from the same village, who has over 15 acres of family land, speaks of a similar experience that left him poorer. “A local pea processing industry asked me to plant green peas. In 2012, representatives of the company approached me and said they would pay ₹8.5 per kg. They prepared some documents as well. I planted the crop. When the crop was ready, I took a tractor trolley with around 100 bags (50 kg each) of produce to their unit, but they were unwilling to buy my crop citing poor quality. It was only after the intervention of local farmer outfits that they purchased my crop. Later, I sold the rest of my crop that I had sown in five acres of land at ₹2-₹3 per kg in the local mandi (market place). I had to bear heavy lossses,” he says. “I can’t trust them anymore.”
The story is no different in other parts of the State. In Tibba Tapprian village in Rupnagar district, Dharmpal Singh, who owns close to three acres of land, says he sold 25 quintals of maize crop at ₹800/q at the Balachaur mandi a few days ago. “The government announces the MSP, but what’s the use if I have to sell my crop below the MSP? Government agencies should buy farmers’ produce at the MSP or make it legally mandatory for private traders to purchase crop at the MSP,” says the 56-year-old.
A senior government official points out that the government did not intervene as maize is not distributed under the Public Distribution System (PDS). “Government purchases only those crops that are distributed under the PDS. Maize is not among those crops,” says Gurvinder Singh, Joint Director at Punjab’s Agriculture Department.
 Surjit Singh, 65, fears that mandis under the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) will gradually vanish if private trade is allowed without any government regulation. “Trade within the mandi through the arthiya (commission agent) is taxable, which includes rural development fee, market fee and the commission of the agent. But after these bills, no taxes will be levied on trade outside the regulated mandis,” he says. “That means private traders and companies can offer a higher price to farmers as they won’t have to pay tax. Once they start offering a better price to farmers than what is offered in the mandis, it is but natural that farmers will be inclined to sell their produce to them. And over time, with trade outside the mandis growing, the mandis will eventually disappear. As I stand against the new bills, I have decided I’ll sell my crop of Basmati rice only through the mandi. But for how long will I be able to do this? I can negotiate with private traders or companies to some extent because I have better resources than the small and marginal farmers (he owns over 25 acres of land in Patiala’s Lachkani village). Yet, against the big corporate houses, it will be a losing battle,” he says.

A strong, age-old bond
While the government says farmers can now trade anywhere, Gurmukh Singh, 47, asks how that will be possible as they cannot afford the hefty transport costs. Gurmukh is a small farmer with around four acres of family land in Lachkani village. He has sown paddy in his field. With hardly any resources to store or transport his produce, he is extremely worried. “Once I harvest my crop, I sell it at the local mandi. Even if I get a higher price from private traders in some faraway place, it won’t be easy for me take my produce there. I do not have the capacity or resources to trade my crop at distant places. So, even if the bills promise us the freedom to sell anywhere, it seems a distant dream in practice,” he says.
“Moreover”, he adds, “I can’t leave my commission agent for private traders. The relation with my arthiya goes back generations. Whenever I am in need, I get money from him. He pays me in advance for the crop that is to be harvested. Such a relationship based on trust will be difficult to establish with private traders or companies.”

In Patiala’s Ranbirpura village, Avtar Singh, who owns two and a half acres of land, is equally grateful to his commission agent. “I have already taken an advance of ₹1 lakh from him for the paddy crop that I had planted this season. It would have been next to impossible for me to cultivate my farm if my arthiya had not given me the advance. He gave me an advance only because he is assured that my paddy crop, which I’ll sell through him, will be purchased by government agencies at the MSP. If the government stops purchasing paddy or wheat at the MSP, I don’t think I’ll be able to cultivate any crop on the farm. No one will give me an advance or offer any financial help without a tangible guarantee,” he says.
Avtar fears that once the parallel private market starts functioning outside the regulated market, there will eventually be no MSP in that market. “The government should come out with another bill making MSP a statutory right of the farmers,” he says.

Commission agents and labourers working in grain markets have their own concerns about the new bills. “The government has announced the MSP for several crops but it is only for wheat and paddy that farmers actually get the MSP. And that’s because the government buys it. For instance, this year, government agencies purchased wheat at an MSP of ₹1,925/q during the official procurement. But now, after government purchase, the wheat is being bought by private traders at ₹1,600/q-₹1,650/q in the mandi here. The government, it seems, wants to remove us from the market,” says Mulk Raj Gupta, president, Arthiya Association, Patiala new grain market. “But they possibly don’t realise how many people are generating employment in this entire chain, be it labourers, staff at shops, employees of market committees or others,” he says.
In the grain market, Badri Mukhiya, 45, who hails from Bihar, ropes in labourers from his State. He says he has been coming to Punjab since 1990, but is now worried after hearing that work at the mandi could reduce. Work includes loading and unloading of produce and cleaning of grain. “If farmers stop coming to the mandi altogether or even if fewer farmers come, there will be less work. The livelihood of at least 20 people and their families who are associated with me is dependent on the work we do here. We earn around ₹400 a day, but we will have to return to our native place if there’s no work. Everyone is worried,” he says.

  Concerns and responses
Agricultural experts have expressed their reservations about the bills as well. Lakhwinder Singh, Professor of Economics and Coordinator at the Centre for Development Economics and Innovation Studies at Punjabi University, Patiala, has been mapping rural Punjab for decades. He says these bills have generated a lot of suspicion as they were passed through the ordinance route. “The new bills state that the foodgrain trade will be in the hands of private traders. But no safeguards have been enacted. The majority of farmers in India are small and marginal farmers. They usually wait for the crop to be harvested in order to fulfil their basic needs. They don’t have the capacity to trade the food at distant places. Therefore, the claim that farmers will have the freedom to sell does not hold true. Giving private players the freedom of foodgrain trade without any regulation will eventually lead to the emergence of monopolies, oligopolies or a cartel system,” he says.

Noted economist and professor at the Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University, Sukhpal Singh, points out that 86% of Indian farmers have less than five acres of land, and 67% of farmers have less than two and a half acres of land. “These are the victims of the grave economic crisis. How can these small farmers sell their produce in other markets? What is the purpose of new markets if small farmers cannot participate in them? How will the new private markets operate? These new markets will not have any regulation and they won’t be taxed by the State government. State governments will regulate only the already running markets. In Punjab, for instance, these markets levy 8.5% tax, including 3% market fee, 3% rural development fund, and 2.5% commission of the commission agents. Thus this year, the tax is around ₹155/q on paddy and about ₹164/q on wheat. This means that due to non-tax on private purchase, the purchase of paddy and wheat will be cheaper for private buyers to the extent of ₹155-₹164/q. Initially, even if private markets offer farmers ₹55/q-₹64/q on paddy and wheat purchases, they (private traders) would still get a profit of ₹100/q. Government procurement will be affected as farmers will be inclined towards private markets. As the volume of purchase increases in the new system, the government will reduce its purchase target. Gradually, government procurement will be negated. In such a situation, the prices of crops in private markets will be reduced,” he says.
In response to all these concerns, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a series of tweets in English, Hindi and Punjabi that MSP will continue. “Government procurement will continue. We are here to serve our farmers. We will do everything possible to support them and ensure a better life for their coming generations,” he tweeted. He added the government was bringing in these provisions as middlemen have been bullying farmers for years.

Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also tried to allay fears. He said the APMC system will continue. Alleging that the Opposition was trying to mislead the country, Tomar said, “Farmers, so far, were forced to sell their produce in mandis. In Punjab there’s 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, through these bills, the farmers will be able to sell their produce even outside the ambit of the mandi.”
The distance between traders and farmers will reduce now, Tomar told Parliament. “If a trader will visit a village, farmers of that village will assemble at one place to sell their produce. [The] trader will fix the rate of purchase after discussing with farmers. The trader will purchase the produce and take that away in a truck. Farmers will not have to go anywhere to sell their produce,” he said.

Playing politics over the bills
Despite the government’s assurances, concerns persist, and not only among the Opposition parties. After initially supporting the ordinances pushed by the National Democratic Alliance government, Shiromani Akali Dal, an old alliance partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party, decided to take a U-turn on the issue. The Akali Dal’s lone representative in the Union Cabinet, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, quit the Cabinet in protest against the bills. In her resignation letter to the Prime Minister, Badal wrote, “In view of the decision of the Government of India to go ahead with the Bill on the issue of marketing of agricultural produce without addressing and removing the apprehensions of the farmers and the decision of my party, Shiromani Akali Dal not to be a part of anything that goes against the interests of the farmers, I find it impossible to continue to perform my duties as a minister in the Union Council of Ministers.”
The Akali Dal has also accused the Congress government in Punjab of “double speak” on the issue. The Congress government in 2017 amended the State APMC Act after coming to power in Punjab to include provisions similar to those in the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Akali Dal claimed. According to the State Act, trade can be done only after obtaining a licence from the government in its mandis under the Punjab Mandi Board or the private mandis. However, according to the Centre’s new farm bills, no licence from the State government is required; any PAN card holder can engage in trade. Besides, no private or government mandi is required for trade under the new farm bills. Trade can be done outside the physical premises of markets or deemed markets notified under various State agricultural produce market laws.
The ruling Congress party, on the other hand, accused the Akali Dal of misleading people on the farm bills and asked the party to part ways with the NDA. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said that the Akali Dal’s claims of standing shoulder to shoulder with the farmers are hollow as long as it remains a part of the Central government.
In neighbouring Haryana, Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, whose Jannayak Janta Party is part of the coalition government with the BJP, has made it clear that while there’s no mention of doing away with the MSP in the farm bills, he will quit if the MSP is indeed discontinued. That leaves a question mark on the alliance.
Watch | Why are the agriculture bills being opposed?
 While parties spar with one another, farmers are concerned about the present. On September 25 afternoon, hundreds of angry farmers sat on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway at the Shambhu border of Punjab-Haryana, protesting against the bills. Jasbir Singh, 55, who owns two and a half acres of land in Kutha Kheri village in Patiala’s Rajpura Tehsil, says he has enough cash in hand to undertake farming operations. “But after harvesting my paddy crop, I’ll be needing money for sowing wheat in my field. It’s only my arthiya who will give me an advance. If mandis go redundant and arthiyas go away, how will I sustain myself? I am under a debt of about ₹2.5 lakh. I don’t think I have a choice but to sell my land,” he says as he drops his head in despair."
45,"Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT) has decided to conduct a Common Entrance Test (CET) for admissions to the four IIITs in the State in November.
Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh on Friday said the university would depart from the usual practice of admitting students based on their marks in mathematics and science subjects in Class 10 this year due to the prevailing pandemic, which necessitated cancellation of the SSC examination and declaration of all students as ‘pass’.
Syllabus
Speaking after releasing the results of the Integrated Common Entrance Test (ICET-2020), the Minister said the test would be for 100 marks (50 for mathematics and 50 for science) based on the Class 10 syllabus.
Mr. Suresh said efforts would be made to set up one examination centre in every mandal, besides setting up test centres in Telangana.
“The examination will be tentatively in the first or second week of November,” he said.
Six of the top 10 rank holders in the ICET-2020 belong to the SC and ST sections, and four among the 10 toppers are girls.
The toppers are Daruri Phanith, Rayudu Abhiram, B. Subhasri, Avinash Sinha, Vemula Anil Kumar, Sekharamantri Avinash, Koilada Lokeswari, Shitti Venkatesh, Sarvani GDS and Gongada Lakshmi Lavanya in that order.
Of the total 64,884 candidates who registered for ICET-2020, 51,991wrote the test and 40,890 of them passed (78.6%).
Sri Venkateswara University conducted the test on behalf of the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE). Vice-Chancellor Satish Chandra was the Chairman and M. Srinivasa Reddy was its convener.
The ICET notification inviting applications from students seeking admission into MBA and MCA courses was released on February 29 and the examinations were conducted on September 10 and 11 in 75 centres.
As many as 352 colleges in the State offer courses in MBA. These colleges have 44,084 seats, besides 31,368 convener seats. Similarly, 130 colleges in the State have 8,558 seats, besides 6,229 convener seats, in the MCA courses.
The Minister said that the results were released in a record two weeks.
Second chance for COVID-hit
Referring to the EAMCET that was completed on Friday, he said a total 1,56,899 students had appeared for the engineering stream and 75,834 candidates had written the test for admission into agriculture and medicine streams.
The Minister said that 21 COVID-19-infected students could not write EAMCET. Six students could not write ICET for similar reason. They would be given one more chance to write the test on October 7, he added."
46,"The BJP alleged here on Friday that the Delhi University Executive Council has passed a proposal to bring 12 aided colleges, which it has jurisdiction over, under Delhi University.
This, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta alleged, illustrated the “failure” of the Arvind Kejriwal-led government which, he argued, had no right to remain in power since it had failed at running these colleges.
“The Kejriwal government only talks big and blames its failures on others. He is not being able to run the colleges aided by the Delhi government,” Mr. Gupta alleged.
“The Deputy Chief Minister is blaming the college administrations for hiding his failures and misusing his rights. He even asked to spend the students’ fund to pay salaries to the teachers. First, the guest teachers of schools were made to wait for months for their salary, then the college teachers were made to wait for their salary,” he also alleged.
Mr. Gupta also accused the Delhi government of attempting to handover the Delhi Jal Board to private companies as a result of “six years of failure” at providing quality potable water to people round the clock. “Under the pretext of private companies, the Kejriwal government is looking for an option to escape from its responsibilities,” he alleged."
47,"Sripathi Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam was born in an orthodox Telugu Brahmin family on June 4, 1946, to Sambammurthy and Sakuntalamma.
The legendary singer, popular among his admirers as Balu, had been an ardent music lover right from his childhood days, closely observing his father, a Harikatha artiste.
While pursuing his engineering course (AMIE) in Madras (now known as Chennai) in 1964, he was adjudged winner (best singer) in a local music competition, wherein legendary singer Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao was the judge.
SPB had etched his name in the Guinness Book of Records by singing 40,000 songs in 16 Indian languages.
In 1966, veteran Telugu actor Padmanabham had given Balasubrahmanyam a chance to sing in his film, ‘Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna’. The music director of the film was S.P. Kodandapani, whom Balasubrahmanyam considered his mentor and even named his recording theatre in Chennai after him.
Balasubrahmanyam was a versatile singer, music composer, actor, dubbing artiste, film producer and TV anchor. He sang for three generations of South Indian heroes such as N.T. Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, M.G. Ramachandran, Sivaji Ganesan, Rajkumar, and Vishnuvardhan and later for Krishna, Sobhan Babu, and Krishnam Raju, and thereafter (during 1970s and 1980s) for Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna, Balakrishna and Venkatesh in Telugu and Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth and other heroes in Tamil.
He also sang for present-day heroes in Tollywood such as Jr. NTR, Maheshbabu, Pawan Kalyan, Raviteja and Allu Arjun.
National awards
Balasubrahmanyam made a foray into Bollywood with a bang. His popular number, ‘Ek Duje Keliye’, won him the second national award. His first national award was for the Telugu film ‘Sankarabharanam’, which he considered as his career best.
He had won four more national awards for the films ‘Saagara Sangamam’ and ‘Rudraveena’ (Telugu) , ‘Sangeeta Saagara Ganayogi Panchakshari Gavai’ (Kannada), and ‘Minsaara Kanavu’ (Tamil).
He had received seven Filmfare awards and 25 Nandi awards presented by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. He had also received the NTR National Award in 2012 and the ‘Indian Film Personality of the Year’ in 2016.
Record of sorts
Balasubrahmanyam also held the world record for recording 21 songs in one day (from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) in Kannada for music director Upendra Kumar on February 8, 1981. He had also recorded 19 Tamil songs in one day and 16 Hindi songs in a single day, a record envied by his contemporaries.
Balasubrahmanyam had become the voice of actor Salman Khan in the 90s singing for him in most of his films.
‘Maine Pyar Kiya’ and ‘Hum Aap ke Hai Kaun’ songs had helped him establish firmly in the Bollywood. He made a comeback in 2010 with a song for Shahrukh Khan’s ‘Chennai Express’.
Balu had acted in about 75 films in three South Indian languages, which included 38 in Telugu. He had lent his voice for Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth, Anil Kapoor, Girish Karnad, Gemini Ganesan, Vishnuvardhan and Salman Khan when their films were dubbed into Telugu.
He had lent his voice to the protagonist of the film ‘Gandhi’ played by Ben Kingsley when the Oscar-winning film was dubbed into Telugu.
He had taken upon himself the task of spotting young talent by hosting ‘Paadutaa Teeyaga’, a reality-based Indian singing competition in Telugu, telecast on ETV Telugu."
48,"There must be triumphant laughter in the resting places of those who argued in the 1940s that India is not suited for parliamentary democracy. Their reasons varied from the political culture to the proverbial social diversity of India, or even the Gandhian idea of swaraj that were construed as not easily amenable to forge representative institutions characteristic of parliamentary democracy.
Providing the lead
At the same time, there were others who forcefully defended the appropriateness of parliamentary democracy for India on grounds of representativeness, responsiveness and accountability. They argued that the wielders of power have to continuously demonstrate their responsiveness to public interest on a day-to-day basis in this dispensation; that even a small minority can play a significant role, and that those who wield public power would be subject to a close audit of their actions at the level of their constituencies.
Comment | A politics of avoidance that must be questioned
There is a running thread across the Constituent Assembly Debates that Parliament at the Centre and legislatures in the States would be the key institutions around which parliamentary democracy in India would revolve. While the State legislatures in India have tended to largely imitate Parliament, without evolving an institutional culture of their own to this end, much rested on Parliament to provide a lead in this regard. While there were a few buds of hope in this regard at times, they seem to be withering far too early.
Committee system
Over the years, the Indian Parliament has increasingly taken recourse to the committee system (as its counterparts did elsewhere). This was not merely meant for house keeping, to enhance the efficacy of the House to cope with the technical issues confronting it and to feel the public pulse, but also to guard its turf and keep it abreast to exercise accountability on the government.
Some committees such as the Estimates Committee and Public Accounts Committee (that even go back to the colonial period) have a commendable record in this regard. The executive in independent India, irrespective of the parties in power, was not very disposed to committees of scrutiny and oversight, sometimes on the specious plea that they usurped the powers of Parliament. This was far from the case. They were guardians of the autonomy of the House: the committees of scrutiny and oversight, as the case with other committees of the House, are not divided on party lines, work away from the public glare, remain informal compared to the codes that govern parliamentary proceedings, and are great training schools for new and young members of the House. In the discharge of their mandate, they can solicit expert advice and elicit public opinion. The officialdom in India has often attempted to take cover under political masters to avoid the scrutiny of committees. Besides the standing committees, the Houses of Parliament set up, from time to time, ad hoc committees to enquire and report on specific subjects which include Select Committees of a House or Joint Select committees of both the Houses that are assigned the task of studying a Bill closely and reporting back to the House.

Some faultlines
While there is much to commend about the routine working of the parliamentary committee system in India, it has not been creative or imaginative. The presiding officers of the Houses who had to give up leadership in this regard have tended to imitate changes and innovations done elsewhere (such as in Britain). The chairman of the Rajya Sabha, being the Vice-President of India, cannot probably distance himself much from the stance of the Cabinet, but even when it comes to the Lok Sabha, very few Speakers, with exceptions such as G.V. Mavalankar, P.A. Sangma and Somnath Chatterjee, have taken cudgels with their party leaders to uphold the autonomy of the House.
However, ground was broken in 1993 when 17 Committees (later increased to 24) of Parliament, the Departmentally-related Standing Committees (DRSCs), drawing members from both Houses roughly in proportion to the strength of the political parties in the Houses, were set up.

They were envisaged to be the face of Parliament in a set of inter-related departments and ministries. They were assigned the task of looking into the demands for grants of the ministries/departments concerned, to examine Bills pertaining to them, to consider their annual reports, and to look into their long-term plans and report to Parliament.
A gradual marginalisation
It is important to point out that committees of scrutiny and advice, both standing and ad hoc, have been confined to the margins or left in the lurch in the last few years. Data by PRS India brings this out eloquently. While 60% of the Bills in the 14th Lok Sabha and 71% in the 15th Lok Sabha were wetted by the DRSCs concerned, this proportion came down to 27% in the 16th Lok Sabha.
Apart from the DRSCs, the government has shown extreme reluctance to refer Bills to Select Committees of the Houses or Joint Parliamentary Committees. The last Bill referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee was The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Second Amendment) Bill, in 2015. Some of the most momentous Acts of Parliament in recent years such as the radical overhaul of Article 370 that revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divided the State into two Union Territories were not processed by any House committee.

Given their large-scale implications and the popular protests against them, the three Bills related to agricultural produce and the three labour Bills that overhauled conditions of work, terms of employment, grievance redress and social security in the monsoon session of Parliament were cases that definitely deserved to be scrutinised by Select Committees of the Houses. But the government used its majority in both the Houses of Parliament and steamrolled the Bills (with hardly any discussion), amid the predictable din and noise that a fragmented Opposition could mount.
Setting aside a culture
There is no dearth of scholarly literature to suggest that the committee system has greatly enhanced the capacity of Parliament to carry out its mandate. So, why has the ruling dispensation neglected this?
One of the reasons given at this point in time is the novel coronavirus pandemic and the urgent need to enact safety measures. The argument of urgency seems spurious given the fact that some of the most controversial Bills introduced in the House, such as relating to labour and the farm sector, were vehemently opposed by the groups concerned and clearly aimed at market reforms. If it is urgency, then the Women’s Reservation Bill, on which there was a broad consensus in the House, should have come up upfront.
Comment | Parliament and its panels
Clearly, this regime is not disposed to a reflection and reconsideration of Bills proposed in the House. It does not seem to believe that the primary role of Parliament is deliberation, discussion and reconsideration, the hallmarks of democratic institutions, but a platform that endorses decisions already arrived at. Further, what is ominous is the encroachment into the powers of a State that some of these bills reflect, and the reinforcement of the central authority they portend.

It was a tough road from Kabul to Doha for all three actors involved — the Afghan government, the Taliban, and, most importantly, the United States. Now, that they have met in Doha, the road back to Kabul will be more challenging, given the inherent differences on the Afghan endgame among these three actors."

51,"A team of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is expected to visit Assam soon to check the health of former Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi.
Mr. Gogoi was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Thursday due to post-COVID-19 complications. His admission almost coincided with the discharging of another former Chief Minister, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, from a private hospital where he had undergone treatment for a neurological ailment.
“We had a videoconference with AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria in the morning to discuss Mr. Gogoi’s health condition. He expressed satisfaction with the line of treatment by the GMCH doctors and advised some tests,” Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists on Friday.
He added that a team of AIIMS specialists would be arriving “in a day or two” for treating the former Chief Minister, whose parliamentarian son Gaurav Gogoi participated in the videoconference too.
Mr. Sarma said the former Chief Minister’s health improved on Friday compared to what it was on Thursday. “He is maintaining a saturation level of 94 with three litres of oxygen compared to 92 with six litres of oxygen 24 hours ago,” he said.
Panel for Bodoland
Meanwhile, Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi on Friday formed a four-member panel for redrawing the map of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) and increasing the number of councils from 40 to 60.
Mandated by the Bodo Accord of January 29, the BTR would be an “upgraded” version of the existing Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), which has been under the Governor’s Rule since April 27 after the expiry of its term."
52,"Students and youth under the banner of Fridays For Future (FFF), a global movement demanding climate justice, protested outside the Union Environment Ministry on Friday afternoon.
“We are asking for our rights. Not begging to anyone”, “Scrap Draft EIA 2020”, “Emergency! Seas are rising” were some of the slogans the protesters wrote on a road opposite to the Ministry. They also carried placards and raised slogans and demanded the government to act against the climate crisis.
“Stop denying, our earth is dying,” read one placard. “Make love, not CO2,” read another. The group also said they would be submitting a detailed list of demands to the Delhi government next week.
The FFF is a global climate strike movement that started in August 2018, when 15-year-old Greta Thunberg began a strike in Sweden."
