0,"Domestic workers staged a dharna in front of the AG’s Office here on Thursday demanding a comprehensive law for better working conditions, compensation to domestic workers who have lost jobs, and implementation of the urban employment scheme.
The protest organised under the umbrella of the SEWA-Union was part of a national agitation against the changes brought by the Union government to labour laws.
Inaugurating the protest, Sonia George, general secretary of the SEWA-Union, said the dharna was the first of protests by domestic workers.
In a statement here, the SEWA-Union said domestic workers were among the section of workers who had lost their jobs the most. Though they provided an essential service, they were being kept away from the workplace on the grounds of being virus carriers. The labour bills passed by Parliament did not cover domestic workers.
Ms. George said the Code on Social Security did not define private homes as an establishment or define an employer. Till then, workspaces of domestic workers would not get any recognition and they would not be able to highlight any violation of labour rights in that space.
There were apprehensions that the domestic workers would not get any entitlements if they could not prove they were a worker, though the Union government’s argument was that they were universalising social security benefits, she said."

3,"Sabbani Janakiramulu, an oustee of Mamidyala village in Mulugu mandal attempted suicide by dousing himself with kerosene before the Revenue Divisional Office (RDO) at Gajwel on Thursday.
Mr. Janakiramulu alleged that for the past few years he has been denied Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) benefits and repeated appeals to officials failed to yield results.
Mr. Janakiramulu came to RDO office with kerosene bottle. However, those present at the spot threw away the kerosene bottle and informed the police. Police immediately shifted him to a station, where they registered a case and are investigating.
According to sources, S. Narasmihulu, S. Janakiramulu and Harikrishna are brothers and had a house spread on 350 yards and three acres of land. The land and house were acquired by the government for Kodapochammasagar reservoir and they were given compensation. However, they were not offered R&R package.
“We gave away our land and house for the construction of Kondapochamma reservoir. In the first list, houses were allotted to about 400 plus oustees of the village. In the second list, names of as many as 181 persons were identified but allotment was made to only 137 persons, while the remaining are still waiting. Our names are in second list which means we are eligible for houses. But, despite moving around Revenue offices, we are not being allotted houses and officials are not responding properly. Myself and my brother Harikirshna have migrated to Kukatpally about a decade back to make a living. But those who migrated well before us from the village got the R&R package and why cannot we is our question,” Mr. Janakiramulu told The Hindu.
“Janakiramulu is not eligible for R&R package as he is not staying in the village for the past one-and-a-half decade. The other compensations were already paid to him. A case was registered against him for creating nuisance at Gajwel police station,” said RDO D. Vijayender Reddy.

4,"The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case against a senior bank official and two others, including a functionary of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, in connection with the seizure of ₹11.48 crore by the Income Tax Department in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Vellore.
Searches were conducted on the premises of the trio and investigators seized certain documents relating to the case, sources in the agency said on Thursday.
A couple of days ago, the CBI’s Anti-Corruption Branch registered a case against Dayanidhi, the then senior manager, Canara Bank, Vellore, DMK functionary ‘Poonjolai’ Srinivasan, his brother Damodaran and others in connection with the seizure of several wads of newly- printed currency of ₹200 denomination. The case was registered under Section 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 477(A) (falsification of accounts) and other provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
The agency said reliable information had been received that the Income Tax Department conducted searches on the premises of Mr. Damodaran in Vellore on April 1, 2019, and seized ₹11.48 crore. During the course of investigation, Mr. Srinivasan claimed that the money belonged to him and was meant for distribution to voters in the Vellore Parliamentary constituency ahead of the election. Based on the seizure, the election was cancelled in the Vellore Lok Sabha constituency and a case was registered against D. Kathir Anand (the candidate and son of senior DMK leader Duraimurugan) under the provisions of the IPC and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, relating to distribution of cash to voters.
The CBI said in the First Information Report that the cash in ₹200 denomination was obtained from the currency chest of Canara Bank, Vellore, by exchanging notes of other denominations. Mr. Dayanidhi had allegedly colluded with the accused persons by abusing his official position and hence committed the offence of criminal misconduct.
“The currency was obtained for facilitating easy distribution of currency notes to the voters in the Vellore Parliamentary constituency during the Parliament election which was to be held on 18.04.2019,” the agency said and added that the activity promoted corruption.
In a formal note to the CBI, the bank authorities confirmed that the senior manager had exchanged the currency notes in the chest without following due procedures. The searches come a couple of days after Mr. Anand, who later contested and won the election, complained that two persons posing as police officials barged into his room at Tamil Nadu House, New Delhi, and questioned him on the issues that the party was planning to raise in Parliament.
Parrying questions on the nature of seizures made on the premises of the trio on Thursday, a CBI official said the agency would summon them soon for questioning. The investigator refused to comment on the role of the MP in the case and also whether he would be questioned."
5,"A 22-year-old youngster from Gundala village in Ranga Reddy district, on Thursday admitted to killing his father 50-days ago and later buried his body in their agriculture field. His mother Lalitha allegedly helped him.
Shamshabad Deputy Commissioner of Police N Prakash Reddy said that the offence took place on the night of July 30 over petty disputes. The accused, Rakesh, told police that his father S. Kistaiah alias Krishna, a farmer, was physically abusing Lalitha, and him after consuming liquor.
On the fateful night too, Kistaiah picked up a heated argument with them, following which the mother-son duo throttled him to death, police said.
“While Rakesh was throttling, Lalitha held Kistaiah's legs. After 10 p.m., they took the body to their field on a bike, about two kilometres from the house, where they dug a pit and buried it,” Mr. Reddy said.
When relatives and family members enquired about the victim's sudden disappearance, the accused told them that Kistaiah was working in Hyderabad as a daily wager owing to financial problems.
""Even after 50-day when he did not return, their relatives grew suspicious and confronted Rakesh, who later confessed of killing his father with the help of his mother,"" the DCP said.
He said that a case was registered and the victim's body will be exhumed on Friday morning. Later, the remnants of the body will be sent to the government hospital for autopsy."
6,"TDP Polit Bureau member and Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has demanded that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy spell out the outcome of his visit to Delhi.
“Mr. Jagan has made many visits to Delhi since he assumed office, and it is his bounden duty to tell people about the new projects he brought for the State,” Mr. Ramakrishnudu said in a statement on Thursday.
Mr. Ramakrishnudu sought to know why the Chief Minister was maintaining silence on all major issues, including his visits to Delhi.
Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s meetings with the Union Ministers were solely aimed at saving his skin and coming clean out of the cases filed against him. All his visits to Delhi and deeds were at the cost of larger interests of the people, he said, adding, “It has become a routine for the CM to commit atrocities in the State and go to Delhi to get reprimanded for his omissions.”
Accusing the YSRCP of perpetrating a “loot and hoard” regime on the people of the State, Mr. Ramakrishnudu deplored that the Chief Minister had not been acting in a desired fashion with regard to promises made in the Reorganisation Act.
Though the Amaravati capital issue was pending before the court, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his MPs were repeatedly raising the issue with the Central government, he said.
Mr. Ramakrishnudu expressed surprise that the State government had stopped all development works and projects, but was asking the Centre for funds.
“Mr. Jagan has no minimum understanding that Central funds will be released only if the government shows some progress on the projects. There will be no support if the State goes on misusing the funds in every way possible,” he said."
7,"A person accused of child sexual abuse escaped recently from the first-line treatment centre (FLTC) being run at the convention centre of the Kochi airport, throwing light on the challenge being faced by the police in guarding those who have tested positive for SARS-COV-2.
The infected among those arrested by the police and excise are put up at the FLTC at Kochi airport along with other infected members of the public. Though police personnel are put on guard duty at the centre, the security remains far from foolproof.
“We have taken up the matter with the District Disaster Management Authority, that it is really tough to keep a tab on the accused who mix with the civilians. A possible solution is a separate FLTC exclusively for the arrested. With those arrested increasingly testing positive since September, the task is getting progressively difficult,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief.
While the centre has multiple entries and exit points, police are deployed only at the main entrance, which is more than 100 metres away from the facility. “The accused are not always in the sight of the police guards who have to largely depend on information from health and paramedical staff at the centre. We have already petitioned the District Police Chief and now plan to raise it with the District Collector as well,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam Rural) of Kerala Police Association."
8,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asked public representatives and officials to work round-the-clock for the strict implementation of the recent legislations enacted by the State government as they were people-centric and aimed at their welfare.
At a meeting with public representatives of municipalities and Mayors of various other municipal corporations, Mr. Rao said the objective of the legislations is to see that the poor do not suffer in the deliverables of the government. The fruits of the legislations should go up to the last mile, he said.
He asked the participants at the meeting to involve themselves at the grassroots level in the online registration of non-agriculture properties like plots, flats and houses.
As part of revolutionary administrative reforms in the State, the government had enacted several legislations for effective use of people for decades. However, the poor should not be adversely affected in the implementation of the Acts, he said.
Mr. Rao said the government has no intention of filling its purse with money collected from poor through regularisation of lands.
He asked officials to prepare solutions for problems faced by people in regard to lands and properties before the Dharani portal becomes fully operational. The government would solve all problems linked to residential premises and construction sites which piled up for several decades, Mr. Rao said.
Apprehensions
In the initial days of formation of Telangana, people expressed severe apprehensions that land rates will drop. But, the steps taken by government saw to it that the rates of both agricultural and non-agriculture lands peaked. Good governance led to decline in land disputes, land grabbing, harassment and other related anti-social activities, he said.
He expressed confidence that the government's aim to put the poor high in the priority list would be fulfilled when Dharani portal becomes operational. There will be total protection and security to the properties of the poor. Hutments in urban slums will be replaced by buildings and dwelling houses, he said.
In the interaction that followed with the participants, some of them praised Mr.Rao for his insight into problems of rural and urban areas. The meeting was attended by Ministers and MLAs, including those from Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and others senior officials were also present."
9,"The CPI (Maoist) Charla Local Guerrilla Squad (LGS), which is active in the Chennapuram forest stretch that straddles along the restive inter-State border with Chhattisgarh, has lost its commander Sodi Jogaiah, 25, in Wednesday’s alleged exchange of fire between the police and the Maoist rebels in Chennapuram forest area of Charla mandal.
The police on Thursday identified the bodies of the three Maoists, including two women cadres - those killed in the Chennapuram “exchange of fire” as Sodi Jogaiah of Kistarampadu, Madakam Malli, 22, Maoist dalam member, of Chennapuram, both from Charla mandal, and Madakam Mangi, 24, Charla LGS member, of a tribal hamlet in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh's Kukunoor mandal.
Jogaiah was wanted in connection with four murder cases, including the kidnap and murder of former MPTC member N Srinivasa Rao, owing allegiance to the ruling TRS, of Besta Kothuru village in July last year, police sources said.
Sodi Jogaiah, the Charla LGS commander of the outlawed outfit, was involved in as many as 26 cases of Maoist violence in Bhadrachalam Agency, said Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt.
Jogaiah was the main accused in the murder of former MPTC member N Srinivasa Rao of Besta Kothur in 2019 and also wanted in connection with the murder of a villager in Peddamidisileru in 2017, a youth of Pusuguppa village and a farmer in Kurnapalli in Charla mandal in 2018, the SP said.
The bodies of the three Maoists were handed over to their relatives on Thursday afternoon after postmortem at the Government Area Hospital in Bhadrachalam, he said, adding that the police are trying to bring back their bodies and preserve them in freezers at the Government Area Hospital for re-postmortem as per the orders of the Telangana High Court."
10,"The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is looking to install solar lights along its roads in the State. On a trial basis, the project will be carried out on the Krishnagiri-Walajapet National Highway.
""Going solar will help the environment as it is clean energy. It would also cut down the heavy power bills of toll operators. Also, since it is to be connected to the grid, they will get some relief on the investment. Some contractors pay power bills of up to ₹20 lakh a month for road lighting, which could be brought down,” explained a senior official of the NHAI.
As a first step, the toll plazas will get solar lighting. “We have to study the system and see how it functions for a couple of months before we extend solar power to other places along the highway. The concessionaire has already provided lighting at places where there are human habitations,” said another official.
However, the only hitch in the proposal is the low rate of ₹2 per unit being offered by Tangedco.
“Now, commercial connections are charged ₹9 per unit. We are proposing to supply power to the grid. In such a case, a better rate is only fair. The State government should consider our request,” he said. Tangedco sources said they were only collecting the rates on the basis of what had been stipulated by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Authority. “It is not our decision,"" the official said."
11,"Kottayam recorded its highest single-day spike of COVID-19 cases on Thursday with 343 persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2

In view of the surge in cases, the Health Department has revised its treatment strategy by commencing COVID second-line treatment centres (SLTCs) and promoting home care for asymptomatic patients. At the same time, the rising caseload is stretching the treatment network as medium risk and high-risk patients are increasing proportionately.
Taking note of the situation, SLTCs were opened at Pala, Uzhavoor, and Changanassery by converting the First Line Treatment Centres there. The SLTCs are equipped to provide treatment for medium risk patients, while high-risk patients are being treated at the Government Medical College Hospital and the District General Hospital, which are designated as COVID specialty hospitals."

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, accompanied by his Karnataka counterpart B.S. Yediyurappa, took part in the hour-long parayanam, where the pundits not only recited the verses from the sacred religious text but also gave an in-depth narration of their meaning.
Spiritual programmes
The parayanam is a part of the initiative of the TTD, which has been organising a series of such spiritual programmes for the past 168 days invoking the blessings of the Lord to save humanity from the clutches of COVID-19.
Earlier, both the Chief Ministers offered their prayers at the hill temple.
On their arrival at the main temple complex, they were traditionally received by the priests and top TTD officials with temple honours and led into the sanctum sanctorum, where they stood in front of the main deity and offered their prayers. They also visited the sub-temples while going round the temple complex.
After the customary ‘Vedasirvachanams’, the authorities honoured both the Chief Ministers with silk ‘vastrams’ besides presented them a memento and ‘laddu prasadam’.
Later, both the Chief Ministers drove to the Karnataka State Charities, where they formally laid the foundation stone for the construction of a massive choultry.

23,"Seven Indian Police Service officers from various States undergoing Mid-Career Training Programme (MCTP) Phase-III at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA) tested positive for coronavirus.
As they were asymptomatic, the administration isolated them in special facilities on the campus. The primary contact of the victims were also identified and they too were isolated.
Confirming this to The Hindu, NPA Director Atul Karwal said 79 IPS officials from across the country, with seven to nine years of service, came to their alma mater in the second week of September, to prepare themselves for the next level of competency and honing up skills with a global perspective.
“They were quarantined for 10 days after coming to the campus from their cadre. However, online training started on September 14, as per schedule, which they were attending from their accommodations,” he said.
Last weekend, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody tests were conducted on the quarantined officials, and results were out on Tuesday. Of them, seven tested positive.
“Today, we have started regular training for those who tested negative. Classes are being conducted outdoors as a precautionary measure,” the official said.
“We are facing the pandemic and police officers are the frontline force. All of them have worked as COVID warriors in their States, and for them the chance of infection was obviously high,” Mr. Karwal said, adding that some might have contracted the virus during their journey to Hyderabad. The infected officials were allowed to attend classes online.
He said the NPA could not suspend the training programmes as its alumni were battling from the front. “We are here to set an example,” he said.

33,"With a new high of 6,324 coronavirus (COVID-19) cases on Thursday in Kerala, the pandemic’s course appeared to match projections of a peak in mid-September to the first week of October.
The steep rise was evident from the jump of over 1,000 cases in a day. The State also hiked testing in a 24-hour-period from 51,200 samples on Wednesday to 54,989 on Thursday.
Cumulative cases stood at 1,54,456, and patients treated in hospitals at 45,919. Of these, 371 patients were critically ill and in ICUs, 96 of them on ventilator support.
The State’s toll was also surging, at 613 fatalities, with 21 more deaths added to the toll on Thursday. These occurred between September 4 and 22. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 11 deaths, Alapuzha seven, while one death each was reported from Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode.
Nearly 96% of new cases were locally acquired infections.

34,"The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) Hyderabad has developed a low-cost rechargeable N 95 mask with an increased efficacy.
This has been achieved by using graphene oxide-based paint on one of the layers of the mask.
According to Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, regular N 95 masks filter particles which are 0.3 microns in size with an efficiency of 95%.
“While the fibres of the mask pose as a mechanical barrier, an electrostatic charge on the surface of the mask traps particles. With usage, the electrostatic charge on the N95 masks erodes away, thus, decreasing the filtering efficiency of the mask. To address this bottleneck, researchers in TIFR Hyderabad have developed a low-cost rechargeable N95 mask,” a statement from TIFR reads.
The mask is reusable after standard decontamination procedures without losing its efficiency. It can be recharged with small movements such as the movement of the jaw.
The research was led by Dr. G. Rajalakshmi and Prof. T.N. Narayan along with graduate students Stelbin Peter Figerez and Sudeshna Patra. The researchers have also developed a device for testing masks for quality."

38,"Corporate India has got three more months of relief from invocation of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings by lenders, with the government extending the suspension of relevant provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) against firms defaulting on their loans since March 25 this year.
The IBC’s invocation was first suspended for a period of six months in view of the emergent stress on balance sheets due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the national lockdown announced in March. The Corporate Affairs Ministry notified a further three-month extension on Thursday evening, when that six-month period was due to end.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the extension of the suspension of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC reinforces the government’s commitment to protecting businesses. “It also gives companies breathing time to recover from financial stress,” she said in a tweet. The government had issued an ordinance to amend the IBC in June to enable the suspension of the Code’s provisions for firms committing defaults after March 25. The ordinance permits the government to extend the suspension of insolvency invocation for up to one year, and was passed as a legislation by Parliament this week.
‘Result still elusive’
“The notification was expected but the desired result is still elusive,” said Anoop Rawat, partner, insolvency and bankruptcy at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co.
“The rate of stress resolution outside IBC is abysmal and the stress is only accumulating,” he added. Mr. Rawat hoped the three months could be used to build stakeholder consensus on resolving the stress created on account of COVID-19 to avoid further build-up of stress at the end of the period.
While the economy contracted more than 23% in the first quarter, when the harshest lockdown restrictions were in place, the industry is yet to see a significant revival in revenues as consumers remain cautious and hold on to cash amid a surge in novel coronavirus infections and dwindling jobs and incomes.
The suspension of the corporate insolvency resolution process for another three months will help companies stay afloat, said Uttara Kolhatkar, partner at J. Sagar Associates.
“The current COVID-19 situation has had a debilitating effect on the Indian economic situation and the passing of the Bill will give such stressed companies the much–needed cushioning effect,” she added."

Liver ducts affected
Tejanshu, son of Lakshman and Rajitha from Jannaram mandal, Cherlapalli, was brought to the hospital with a rare disease called Congenital Biliary Atresia (CBA). In this disorder, liver ducts do not develop, and that leads to jaundice and liver failure.
The team of doctors at Pratima Hospitals, Kacheguda, led by senior surgical gastroenterologist Ch. Madhusudan, and gastroenterologist and hepatologist B. Ramesh Kumar, successfully performed the live donor liver transplantation surgery.
Donor father
A portion of the liver was taken from the child’s father and transplanted on him, doctors said.
In a statement here, the doctors said that doing a liver transplant in children is very difficult and needs high skills and expertise because children’s blood vessels are very tiny and lead to liver failure or surgery failure.
The most important thing is the need to perform the surgery with minimal blood loss in children, and so we did it meticulously under a magnifying loop and we did it successfully, said Dr. Madhusudan assuring that in future too, they would do free surgical procedures for the needy.

It has come to the notice of the coordination committee that many people with symptoms of fever, cold and cough had resorted to self-medication before they were tested postive for the virus.
“We found that self-medication delayed the detection of the infection in many patients by a week or more and it led to serious health complications. This is one of the major reasons for the spread of the virus,” Indian Medical Association president (Tirupati region) P. Ravi Raju, who is a member of the COVID-19 coordination committe, told the media here on Thursday.
The committee members are meeting regularly to discuss the spread of the virus and functioning of the COVID-19 facilities in the district.
“The committe members, after a meeting here, said people taking self-medication was predominantly witnessed in the rural areas. Cases of people put under home isolation violating the norms have also come to our notice,” said Dr. Ravi Raju said.
The officials working at the triage centers have been instructed to discourage the patients from rural areas to opt for home isolation.
High recovery rate
“At present, the district has around 10,000 active cases, of which 6,000 are under home isolation. Even as more than 56,000 cases have been reported from the district till date, the recovery rate of more than 85% is quite a relief. However, we should not be complascent and lay focus on checking the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Ravi Raju.
Eighteen special teams of medical and paramedical staff have been working round the clock, covering the government COVID19 facilities set up at Tirupati, Chittoor, Madanapalle, Srikalahasti and Kuppam.
Co-morbid condition
The virus has claimed 620 lives in the district till date. “Majority of the victims had co-morbid health conditions who underwent tests much after they developed symptoms.
“People with symptoms of fever should undergo tests without delay. This is the best remedy to arrest the spread of the virus. Early detection of the infection and timely treatment help can save more lives,” the IMA functionary said."
48,"Deposition by children from the orphanage could become crucial evidence in the case pertaining to sexual assault in a protection home at Ameenpur, registered over a month and a half ago.
The victim of sexual assault, a 14-year-old girl, died last month, while undergoing treatment at Niloufer Hospital.
While the forensic science laboratory report is awaited to ascertain the exact cause of the girl’s death, it is reliably learnt that a few children rescued from the ‘Maruthi Orphanage’ deposed before the Judicial Magistrate of Sangareddy, confirming sexual assault on the girl.
Officials hope that the statements could be a key evidence against the accused — a donor who frequented the home — and two caretakers. Besides, the committee constituted by the Commissioner, Women Development and Child Welfare for probing the case is learnt to have recorded corroborative evidence that confirms sexual assault. The committee, with members drawn from the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, WD &CW, and the Police department, has submitted its preliminary report to the commissioner. Final report will be prepared once the forensic test report arrives.
Commissioner, WD & CD, D. Divya has reportedly written to the government, seeking appointment of a special public prosecutor to argue the case.
The girl’s statement had already been recorded twice, once by the Child Welfare Committee of Rangareddy district, and then by the SCPCR in the government home at Nimboli Adda where the girl was given shelter after a police complaint was filed.
In her statement, the girl pointed finger at primary accused Venugopal Reddy, who visited the home often as “donor”, and caretaker of the home Ch.Vijaya.
The girl said she would be given cool drink and sexually assaulted after she lost consciousness. She would be woken up by other girls in the orphanage, to find herself naked in bed on fifth floor of the building housing the home.
She was abruptly sent away from the home in April this year, on the pretext of pandemic spread. However, family members who took her home found that she was extremely sick, and, upon repeated entreaties, the girl confided in them. After a police complaint was registered, the girl was referred to the government-run protection home and when the situation worsened, she was taken to Niloufer Hospital, where she breathed her last.
The orphanage was seized, and all other children there were rescued and shifted first to various private homes functioning under the WD&CW department, and later to the State Home premises in Yousufguda."
49,"In a setback to trade unions, the Karnataka High Court on Thursday rejected their petitions challenging the legality of amendment made to the labour law extending flexible hiring facility under the ‘fixed-term workmen’ (FTW) policy to all industries.
The court held that there was nothing wrong in the process followed by the State government in amending the Karnataka Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1961, nor is creation of new category of employment under FTW contrary to the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act.
A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order while rejecting the petition filed by Karnataka Industrial and Other Establishments’ Employees Federation.
The petitioner had questioned the legality of the notification issued by the government in June making changes to rules to expand the facility of FTW to all industries as it was available only for the apparel manufacturing sector earlier.
After perusing the records maintained by the government, the Bench declined to accept the contention of the petitioner that no consultation was held with the trade unions before amending the rules. The Bench said the process followed by the government adheres to the manner of holding consultation prescribed by the apex court while noticing that the objections filed by the trade unions to the draft rules were put up by the Commissioner of Labour before the government, which at three levels, Additional Chief Secretary (Labour), Minister for Labour and the Chief Minister had considered the common objections raised by the unions before approving the FTW rule.
Also, the Bench said that the facility of FTW does not violate the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act as it creates a separate employment category on contract basis having pay and other facilities payable equal to permanent employees except that period of employment would not get extended. The Bench also found no merit in the contention of the petitioner that new law violates constitutional provisions.
Employment under the FTW category allows flexibility for industries to hire and fire employees easily. It is seen as more flexible than the contract system, as it enables industries to hire people when a necessary arises and terminate their services when the necessity ceases to exist."

51,"The economy of Tumari and its surrounding villages — approachable only by a barge — is dependent on the Chowdeshwari temple in Sigandur, which used to attract thousands of devotees from different parts of the State. But the temple’s closure for six months and it now being opened only for darshan, sans special pujas, have meant a blow to the economy of several villages.
When this reporter visited Tumari, there were hardly any hotels open. The owner of one hotel was preparing to wind up his business for the day as early as 9 a.m. “There are hardly any visitors. I prepared only dosa and sambar for the day. Our business depends on devotees visiting Sigandur temple,” said Krishna, owner of the hotel.
A majority of the people on the island on the backwaters of Sharavathi are farmers. They have to cross the backwater with the help of barges to reach the mainland. For decades after the construction of Linganamakki dam in 1960s, they hardly saw any development. However, in the last two decades, Sigandur temple became popular, attracting devotees from different parts of the State. It brought in many changes to the lives of people there. “Around 20,000 people are dependent on the temple. Besides hotels, lodges, petty shops, there are around 30 jeep drivers, who carry visitors to the temple soon after they get down the barge. They have no source of income for months. Petty shops at Holebagilu and Kalasavahalli are closed,” said G.T. Satyanarayana, former president of Tumari Gram Panchayat.
Meanwhile, the differences within the administration of the temple have prompted many people to urge the State government to take over the temple, which is right now handled by a private trust.
Shivamogga district administration had submitted a proposal to the government for bringing the temple under the Muzrai Department in 2005 itself, but it has not happened since."
52,"Booking of cases against two city-based jewellery shop owners by the Central Bureau of Investigation brings to the fore the fact of bullion traders taking loans several times more than the value of the yellow metal with a view to make a killing. All is fine as long as the bullion merchants, who speculate on the future price of the yellow metal in the commodities market, service the debts secured from commercial banks without any problem.
They land in a serious trouble when the business plans go haywire. Their accounts turn non-performing when they are not in a position even to pay interest on loans as the price of the yellow metal turns volatile due to developments at the global level, police sources here say referring to the cases filed against Shantilal and Son Jewellers and Shanti Kalash Jewellers on a complaint from a public sector bank for alleged misappropriation of ₹70.13 crore.
Banks prefer to sanction term loan as also overdraft facility to gold merchants in view of the reputation enjoyed by them in the society without fully understanding their business dealings which take turn for the worse in the wake of the fluctuation in the price of the precious metal, the sources say.
Involvement of the loan sanctioning authorities in the banks could not also be ruled out, they add referring to the two cases wherein the owners had secured loan on the pretext of renovating their shops on the Achari street from the Canara Bank branch(then Syndicate Bank branch) at Dargamitta here.
''We will extend all assistance to the CBI if sought to unravel the conspiracy in full,'' they add referring to the cases filed on complaints from the Stressed Management Branch of the bank."

Interim Louisville police chief Robert Schroeder said a suspect was in custody but did not offer details about whether that person was participating in the demonstrations. He said both officers are expected to recover, and one is undergoing surgery.
Several shots rang out as protesters in downtown Louisville tried to avoid police blockades, moving down an alleyway as officers lobbed pepper balls, according to an Associated Press journalist. People covered their ears, ran away and frantically looked for places to hide. Police with long guns swarmed the area, then officers in riot gear and military-style vehicles blocked off roadways.
The violence comes after prosecutors said two officers, who fired their weapons at Taylor, a Black woman, were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend. The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside.
No justice, no peace
The FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in connection with the raid at Taylor’s home on March 13.
Ben Crump, a lawyer for Taylor’s family, denounced the decision as “outrageous and offensive,” and protesters shouting, “No justice, no peace!” immediately marched through the streets.
Scuffles broke out between police and protesters, and some of them were arrested."
55,"In order to understand the diversity of behaviour among elephants and use the knowledge to reduce human-elephant interactions, the Forest Department has started profiling of individual elephants in Coimbatore Forest Division.
In the initial stage, male elephants will be profiled using images of individual animals obtained using camera traps and cameras operated by the field staff.
“Each elephant is different in terms of diversity of behaviour. The profiling helps to identify those elephants that are habituated to human habitats and engage in negative interactions. Such elephants account to a very minuscule population and targeted strategies can be applied to reduce their interaction with humans,” said I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle.
Mr. Anwardeen had implemented profiling of elephants in collaboration with Shola Trust in Gudalur where around 150 elephants were photographed and profiles for 90 individuals were created in three years from 2015.
The exercise had categorised elephants in four categories: transient ones that stay for a very short time during migration season, residents that are shy and never come to human habitation, brash youngsters that engage in crop raiding or attack people in conflict situation, and highly habituated old animals that stay close to humans but barely attack.
Multiple photographs and observation notes of an individual elephant help to create a profile based on its height, age, shape of tusks, shape of tail, pattern of ears and other unique features.
As part of the exercise in Coimbatore Forest Division, where 11 people were killed in elephant attacks and 20 elephants died of various reasons including gunshot in the current year, camera traps have already been placed in 20 key locations in different forest ranges.
“Training for the profiling have been given to all the staff in the forest division ranging from anti-poaching watcher to foresters. Apart from the camera traps fixed in forests, the department has plans to buy cameras for the field staff for the purpose,” said D. Boominathan, landscape coordinator of WWF India, Coimbatore, which is assisting the Department in the log-term exercise.
Places where camera traps have been fixed include Thadagam valley which witnesses movement of elephant to and fro Kerala. Cameras have also been fixed in Sirumugai, Periyanaickenpalayam and Karamadai forest ranges.
According to the Forest Department, moving population of elephant is high in Coimbatore division which is located in the southernmost part of a larger landscape called south Nilgiri Elephant Range - 8 under Project Elephant. Range - 8 consists of two elephant reserves namely Nilambur elephant reserve and Coimbatore elephant reserve, overall elephant population is about 600 as per some studies."

Stating that once a melee happens, like the Galwan clash on June 15, opening fire was not possible, the official pointed out, “Now, we said, if you come close we will fire. Distance is dependent on the conditions like day or night, location and so on... If they are about to be overrun or in self-defence, troops are authorised to fire.”
At the sixth round of Corps Commander talks early this week, India and China had agreed not to send any more troops to the frontline. “It is a good start. We have to wait and watch till there is concrete action on the ground, we will not lower our guard on the ground. Our stand is you moved first, so you move back first. That will be a good confidence-building measure (CBM),” the official said.
The sixth round of senior-level military-level talks also saw a joint statement being issued as well as the participation of an External Affairs Ministry official who deals with China, the official stated. Earlier, the Chinese side had tried to project that India did not have a “unified” stance on the continuing boundary stand-offs.
At the talks since the developments on the south bank since August 29, the Chinese want to resolve the latest incidents first, but India favoured a package resolution of the entire eastern Ladakh situation. “When we say status quo, what we mean is status quo before May,” the official stated.
Chinese deaths
The official revealed that the Chinese had conveyed through diplomatic channels that they had suffered five deaths, including their commanding officer, in the June 15 Galwan Valley clash, which left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead.
Asked why the Chinese had acted in the way they did, the official felt there was “no one overarching reason” but many reasons, including turning Jammu and Kashmir into a Union Territory in August 2019 and also to divert attention from China’s COVID-19 crisis.
Pointing out that the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in other sectors remains stable, the official said that local commanders on both sides were in contact and even they (the Chinese) had said: “Let not what’s happening in eastern Ladakh happen here”.
Interestingly, in the eastern sector, Indian and Chinese troops patrol contentious areas by weekly rotation, a formula that could be brought into play in eastern Ladakh as well.
The official asserted that there was no intelligence failure in detecting the Chinese movements in early May as they made ingress into the Indian side of the LAC. “Whoever moves first has the initiative and the first mover advantage,” the official, said stating they had been monitoring the Chinese all along.
Currently, troops are facing each other at Depsang, the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, and Patrolling Points 17A, Rezang La and Rechin La.
On possible collusion between China and Pakistan against India in the ongoing stand-off, the official said there was no major troop movement on the Line of Control (LoC), and only regular battalion movement was taking place.
“Nothing unusual on that front. We don’t see any build on the other side. But terror activities continue. We are quite strong on the ground, so we eliminate the threat on the LoC,” the official said.
On the global support to India in the ongoing stand-off and the transgressions by China and engagement with Quad countries, the official said: “At the end of the day, you have to fight your own battles”.
On the situation in the Depsang plains, where Chinese troops continue to block Indian patrols to the Patrolling Points 10-13, the official said there were one or two Chinese vehicles near the Y-junction, which kept going back and forth. Beyond the Y-junction, Indian patrols had to go on foot, which were being blocked by Chinese vehicles, the official stated, adding that patrol parties followed protocols and returned. “We have not given up our claims. It has only been temporarily halted due to the circumstances,” the official said."

69,"Manufacturers of corrugated boxes are facing steep increase in cost of raw materials and other inputs and are thus staring at huge losses, according to the Indian Corrugated Case Manufacturers’ Association.
The Indian corrugated box industry, with over 350 automatic corrugators and more than 10,000 semi-automatic units, has seen kraft paper mills increase prices steeply and other conversion input costs spiralling. Overall, there is 18 % to 20 % hike in input costs.
The kraft paper mills say that price of domestic and imported waste paper has increased in the last two months. Since China proposes to ban waste paper imports with effect from January 1, 2021, it is consuming the supplies available now in the global market and this has pushed the prices up. Further, with lockdowns all over the globe due to COVID-19, generation of water paper has fallen. The Indian paper mills could not import adequate volumes during lockdown periods resulting in lower inventory of required grades and shortage in some lower grades.
Sandeep Wadhwa, president of the Indian Corrugated Case Manufacturers Association, appealed to the kraft paper mills to stabilise the prices and to ensure that supply chain in not hampered during the recovery phase. Harish Madan, vice president of the Association, said that unless the box users, including large FMCG brand owners, support the industry, its survival will be difficult."

The centres are being upgraded along the lines of the unit at Marappanapalya ward, which received a facelift after Hasiru Dala, a non-government organisation working on waste management, collaborated with a Netherlands-based firm.
The civic body chose 10 DWCCs in Atturu, Yelahanka Satellite, Jakkur, Kuvempu Nagar, Nagawara, H.B.R. Layout, Rajamahal Guttahalli, Koramangala and Kengeri (159) wards for the first part of the upgradation at a cost of ₹4.75 crore.
“Work on the DWCCs at H.B.R. Layout and Koramangala wards have been completed,” said officials in the BBMP’s Solid Waste Management (SWM) cell. Two centres are likely to be ready by the end of September.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the project by a couple of months, an official said but added that it is now back on track.
The BBMP decided to upgrade the DWCCs last year after an audit of all the centres in the city. The audit was taken up to understand the gaps that exist with respect to operations – from infrastructure, capacity to the financial model. The audit had revealed that 23 DWCCs were unfit for operation, 68 needed minor renovation while 52 could be expanded.
Around 120 DWCCs were servicing 126 wards.
“With the new garbage tenders stressing on separate collection and transportation of different streams of waste, there is a need for all wards to have a DWCC,” said Sarfaraz Khan, BBMP’s Joint Commissioner (SWM).
Officials had been directed to identify locations for setting up new DWCCs in the 78 wards. “The locations are likely to be finalised by the year-end,” Mr. Khan added."
76,"The IPL lost one of its side attractions on Thursday. Dean Jones' untimely demise has robbed the tournament of one of its most perceptive and entertaining commentators.
It may be no exaggeration to say that Jones the commentator had more followers in India than back home in Australia. Remember how he used to dress up as an academician during his stint as Professor Deano for NDTV?
He extended Australia's long tradition of excellent cricketers-turned-commentators. The likes of Ian Chappell, Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry elevated Channel 9 and now Brett Lee, Jones’ colleague on Star Sports Dugout, is a delight too.
Jones, however, had to live through one terrible phase when he was sacked by Ten Sports after he made an insensitive description of Hashim Amla during the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at Colombo in 2006. He regretted his mistake and was able to win back the broadcaster's faith.

 Jones could put a smile on the viewer's face, with his sense of humour. He would also showcase his knowledge of Hindi, like if 52 was needed for victory, he would say: “They now need to make baawan.”
Scott Styris, former New Zealand all-rounder and now a fine analyst, always managed to bring the best out of Jones. During a recent IPL broadcast, Styris was talking to Lee about the speed of pace bowlers. “I was happy with my bowling,” Styris said. “The batsmen were also happy with your bowling,” quipped Jones.
It is hard to believe Jones is no more. You will be missed, Deano!"

78,"The indefinite strike by Karnataka State Health and Medical Education Department Contractual Employees’ Forum and Karnataka AIDS Prevention Society Contract Workers’ Association has partially hit COVID-19 surveillance, testing and reporting in the State.
Over 30,000 employees affiliated to these associations abstained from work starting Thursday demanding pay parity and COVID-19 incentives. While the government has announced COVID-19 incentives for doctors and paramedical staff working under the National Health Mission, it has excluded a majority of staffers on COVID-19 duty.
Protesting this disparity, NHM staffers deployed at Primary Health Centres, taluk and district hospitals apart from COVID-19 Care Centres did not report for work on Thursday.
The protest’s impact was also visible in the COVID-19 health bulletin issued by the Health Department on Thursday. The State reported 7,710 new cases and 65 deaths. Although this is marginally higher than that reported on Wednesday, the numbers are lower than average, which is attributed to the protest.
The total cases went up to 5,48,557 and the toll rose to 8,331. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths. With 6,748 discharges, the total recoveries rose to 4,44,658. Of the remaining 95,549 active cases, 827 patients are being monitored in ICUs of various hospitals.
The number of tests continued to remain lesser that the average 75,000 per day. Only 64,164 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 23,232 rapid antigen tests. Bengaluru Urban saw a record 4,192 cases, the highest single-day spike so far."
79,"In a year of grim tidings, the demise of Dean Jones in Mumbai on Thursday is the latest hammer-blow. Sport has lost an effervescent cricketing star, who made a smooth transition to the commentary box with his swagger and zest intact.
During his prime, the former Australian batsman was all energy and aggression.
He exuded an aura in One Day Internationals (ODI), with shots that blended the conventional and the unorthodox while embellishing it with frenetic running between the wickets.
Jones, Deano to his friends, was a sharp fielder too and he was part of the 1987 World Cup-winning squad helmed by the indomitable Allan Border.
The Madras classic
After a tearful Kim Hughes resigned and left the reins of a weakened Aussie unit to Border in 1984, the latter identified Jones as one of his vital cogs, who along with David Boon, Geoff Marsh, Steve Waugh and Craig McDermott, could revive Australia.
Jones and ODIs shared an adrenaline-loaded bond but he is often remembered for his rousing 210 in the famous Tied Test at Chennai, Madras then, in 1986.
One of the defining pictures of the historic Tied Test was Dean Jones battling heat and dehydration to rack up a superb 210.  
   The enduring images of him batting relentlessly despite the southern metro’s searing heat, egged on by a ruthless Border, is the stuff of legend.
Jones later admitted that he urinated in his pants, vomited on the turf, but soldiered on as his captain wanted him to stay at the wicket.
The Test’s anniversary recently passed us by and just as those old pictures of Jones emerged, he now lies cold in Mumbai. Life’s myriad turns could not be starker!
Broadcast embrace
After a decade of cricket for Australia, the Victorian embraced television, became a perennial fixture in commentary boxes, forged new friendships and was always eager to have a chat.
He could be politically incorrect too and a ghastly word he used to describe South African great Hashim Amla, put Jones to pasture. He apologised profusely and reintegrated himself with the media bandwagon that tails the willow game.
At 59, he had many years of good talk and booming laughter left in him but his heart deemed otherwise and cricket is poorer."

83,"The COVID-19 epidemic is plotting a path almost similar to the projections which spoke of a possible peak in the epidemic curve mid-September to the first week of October.
The exponential rise in the case graph was evident with the State registering 6,324 cases on Thursday, quite a jump by over 1,000 cases registered the previous day.
The State also hiked the number of samples tested in the past 24 hours from 51,200 on Wednesday to 54,989 samples on Thursday. However, it is not quite clear what proportion of these tests are done in the private sector.
The number of recoveries reported on the day was 3,168.
The cumulative case burden now stands at 1,54,456. With 1,07,850 recoveries reported so far, the number of patients currently undergoing treatment in hospitals is 45,919. Of these, 371 patients are critically ill and in intensive care units, with 96 patients on ventilatory support.
The State’s death toll is also surging steadily in proportion to the rise in the total number of cases and now stands at 613, with 21 more deaths being added to the official toll on Thursday. These are deaths which occurred between September 4 to 22. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 11 deaths, Alappuzha 7, while one death each was reported from Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode.
Close to 96% of the new cases —6,054 out of the 6,324 new cases reported on Thursday — are locally acquired infections, including infections reported in 105 health-care workers. In 628 of the cases, the source of infection remains unknown.
The sudden rise in the number of cases put Kozhikode with 883 new cases at the top of all districts. Thiruvananthapuram closely followed with 875 cases, Malappuram 763, Ernakulam 590, Thrissur 474, Alappuzha 453, Kollam 440, Kannur 406, Palakkad 353, Kottayam 341, Kasaragod 300, Pathanamthitta 189, Idukki 151 and Wayanad 106.
The surge in daily case burden is naturally reflected in the number of active cases in each district with Thiruvananthapuram having the maximum number of active patients at 8,446. Kozhikode has 4,927 and Ernakulam, 4,691 patients. Except for Idukki and Wayanad, all other districts have active cases in four-digits.

88,"The Uzhavar Sandhai that was shuttered here as part of COVID-19 containment measures will be reopened in the same location only after number of cases returned to zero. The farmers’ market has since been relocated to two different locations, with the breakup of stalls.
The Uzhavar Sandhai that was a huge draw among Hosur residents was shuttered pre-emptively to avoid an outbreak, especially due to its location. The old farmers’ market was sited on a location with a narrow approach road causing heavy congestion. In its wake, the market was closed to avoid build-up of clusters taking cue from the experience of Koyambedu cluster.
The market was bifurcated with number of stalls divided to be set up on the road abutting Ramanayakkan Lake and at the MGR market for another group. Amid queries of the relocation of market back to its original spot, the corporation has no plans of moving the market back to its erstwhile location as the number of cases in Hosur was steadily spiking on a daily basis.
According to Hosur Corporation Commissioner Balasubramaniam, for now, the Uzhavar Sandhai will continue to operate from its two temporary locations. “The market will not be moved back, until the number of cases came down to zero.”"
89,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is the latest agency to turn its gaze on the actors and party organisers who have been arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) in connection with an alleged drug racket. But this time, it’s the financial activities of the accused that are under the scanner.
The ED on Thursday obtained permission to question actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani as well as three others for alleged money laundering.
During the bail application hearing in the NDPS Court, Special Public Prosecutor P. Prasanna Kumar filed an application seeking permission for the ED to question the accused about their financial activities. Admitting the plea, the court granted the agency permission to question party organiser Viren Khanna, another accused Rahul Thonse, second division clerk in the RTO Ravishankar as well as Ragini and Sanjjanaa for five days at Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara where they are lodged.
Mr. Prasanna Kumar submitted that the CCB, during the course of its investigation, found that the accused financed drug trafficking and earned money from the activity. The ED, through its counsel, stated that in order to unearth and trace the financial trail, it was essential to know details of the property purchased by the accused and investments made.
The counsel cited the recent suspension of Assistant Commissioner of Police M.R. Mudhavi for allegedly helping the accused in return for a payment of ₹50 lakh. He allegedly received ₹12 lakh as an advance from the accused.
“With this, it can be estimated that the accused have huge amount of unaccounted money, which needs to be probed,” Mr. Prasanna Kumar said.
Resort owner summoned
CCB officials, as part of the investigation, summoned Bengaluru-based resort owner Karthik Raju for questioning. According to the police, the accused had organised a party at his resort where drugs were sold and consumed.
“We are probing in detail to ascertain his possible involvement in the racket,” a senior police officer said.
CCB special teams are still searching for three of the prime accused, including Aditya Alva, the son of the late Jeevaraj Alva who served as minister, and party organiser Sheikh Fazil.
Accused tests positive
One of the accused arrested by the CCB has tested positive for COVID-19. According to the police, he is one of the party organisers who is close to several celebrities.
“CCB officials had taken him into police custody for further questioning but on Thursday, his results came positive. He has been shifted to a private hospital for treatment,” said a senior police official.

Mr. Ayyanna Patrudu said that instead of taking action against the accused, the Chief Minister was trying to shield the Minister.

The State had become the first to provide food kits to transgender persons in the first phase of lockdown in March. With the spike in disease, transgender persons have been facing a difficult time.
The government has now sanctioned food kits to the tune of ₹700 each to 1,000 transgender persons who have ID cards, those who have completed screening for the cards, and those who have applied for it.
However, this number forms only a small percentage of the total number of transgender persons in the State. A socio-economic survey in 2014-15 had estimated the number of transgenders in the State at 25,000. They have been further pushed to the margins of society by the pandemic.
Apoorva, a transgender person, used to work as a cook at the Social Justice Department’s shelter for transwomen at Karakkamandapam here but after it closed down, had no income. Consequently, Apoorva had to move back home with her parents. She is also worried about how to meet the hospital expenses of her parents.
Ruby, who too had worked at the same shelter home, had taken up fish business. But after a friend died, all the savings were wiped out. She has not been working since. The rent on her house has been adjusted against the advance, but with no money in hand, she has no option but to move out the next month.
Community members say the food kits provided by the government or the assistance of ₹1,500 provided by the National Institute of Social Defence are only a drop in the ocean. Some have got a breather after shifting to the shelter homes run by the community under a government project.
The increase in funds sanctioned for sex reassignment surgery from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh and self-employment loans announced by the KSWDC are welcome steps, but financial assistance is necessary to tide over the difficult times, they say.
Their hopes are now pinned on a proposal for government assistance of ₹1,000 for 800 transgender persons."

Bobde on Thursday.
The case was listed as number 14 before the Bench. However, it was among several cases on the list which was shifted to “court number 31” for hearing on September 28.
Advocate Ejaz Maqbool, who represents the Jamiat petition and is led by senior advocate Dushyant Dave in court, said in the letter that the case was deleted from the list in the morning. He said the remark about the transfer of the case to “court number 31” was “erroneous”. A list on the court website shows only 10 virtual courts, including the Registrar court, functioning.
The letter addressed to the SC Registry said the media portrayal of a section of the population has affected lives and livelihoods.
“It is relevant to note that this matter is of utmost urgency as there has been a demonisation of a large section of Indians due to the communal twist given to the Nizamuddin Markaz issue, which is affecting the life, livelihood and dignity of such persons so much so that their shops/businesses are being boycotted, they are being attacked, and in some cases even being refused treatment by doctors,” the letter read.
In his e-mail to the Supreme Court Registry, Mr. Maqbool also pointed out that the case was supposed to have been listed on September 23, going by an earlier order.

Also read: Congress to launch nationwide stir against agriculture legislations
In the first of a series of nationwide press conferences that the party plans to hold over the next one month in its campaign against these laws, Mr. Singhvi said the farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, did not explicitly mention MSP anywhere.
The government’s claim was technically correct, that these laws did not explicitly say that the provision of MSP had been removed. But the laws gave the freedom to buy and sell the produce at any cost. “The government’s half-truth is far bigger than any lie”, he stated.
Picking other flaws in the Bills, he said that they gave licence to hoarders. They had liberalised the farm sector, allowing the corporate sector to purchase directly from farms and there was no dispute resolution mechanism in case the farmer felt short-changed, he observed.
These laws, Mr. Singhvi asserted, were unconstitutional, as they legally infringed on the division of power set out by the Constitution between the State and the Centre.
Research study on Bihar
Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh posted a 2019 study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research on Bihar, where, in 2006, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act was abolished.

The main five findings of the report were: it led to a deterioration of public infrastructure, situation of small and marginal farmers remained unchanged as they continued to sell their produce to village-level intermediaries, left a regulatory vacuum in the State and poor public procurement, increased the number of intermediaries and did not attract large-scale private sector investment."
100,"The police have registered a case in connection with what is said to be a fraudulent transfer of ₹ 75.59 lakh from the Shorapur Tahsildar’s account.
Shorapur Police have booked a woman for transferring the funds from the account of Shorapur Tahsildar to the account of Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises, Talikoti in Vijayapura district, on June 1 this year.
According to the police, who quoted Tahsildar of Shorapur Ninganna Biradar as saying in his complaint, accused Lakshmi, wife of Raju Kattimani and a native of Vajjal village in Hunsagi taluk, said to be the owner of Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises, has fraudulently transferred a sum of ₹ 75,59,900 from the account of Shorapur Tahsildar through forgery of the tahsildar’s signature and using the official stamp on a cheque of the Tahsildar that had not been given to Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises.
Mr. Biradar has been handling an official account in the name of Tahsildar Shorapur with Axis Bank in Shorapur and the amount was in this account to be used for natural disaster relief and for expenses that would incur for tackling COVID-19.
An FIR said that the issue came to light on September 22 when Mr. Biradar went to inspect the statement of the account provided by the bank. “The amount of ₹ 75.59 lakh was fraudulently transferred by the accused to an account in the name of Sri Mahalakshmi Enterprises when I was under long-term treatment in a hospital in Kalaburagi and later in Hyderabad for COVID-19 and pneumonia infection,” the Tahsildar has stated in the complaint.

104,"Residents of some villages have taken objection to the State government’s plans to form residential layouts in villages surrounding Belagavi city, saying that they would lose their fertile land.
They said that the Belagavi Urban Development Authority was making efforts to acquire land in 28 villages for creating layouts.
This issue was raised in the taluk panchayat meeting here on Tuesday. Some members said that gram panchayats in all the 28 villages had received notice about land acquisition for construction of residential layouts for urban residents.
Taluk panchayat president Shankargouda Patil said that a resolution would be passed against this and sent to the State government.
However, BUDA officials refuted this. “No notice has been sent for formation of layouts. There is a proposal before the State government to expand the jurisdiction of BUDA. That is yet to be approved,” a senior BUDA officer said. “There is no plan or proposal for acquiring land for residential layouts in any of the new areas, as of now,” BUDA Commissioner Preetam Naslapure said.
BUDA, one of the biggest city development authorities in the State, has a spread of over 192 square kilometres. It stretches from villages such as Kakati and Kangrali on one side and Savgaon, Mandolli and Peeranwadi on the other.
When expanded, it will encompass the Belagavi airport in Sambra, Yallur, Navage and Kadoli on the four sides. The proposal has been forwarded by the district administration to the State government.
Once the new areas are included, then the rules set by BUDA on land use and house construction will have to be followed. Regulations on creating new layouts and residential and commercial complexes will also have to be adhered to. A vision document is being prepared, along with a comprehensive development plan. A detailed plan of the city will be prepared using Geographical Information Systems, under the Centrally aided AMRUT Scheme.
BUDA’s plans for layout development under the farmers partnership scheme is also being opposed.
The urban body plans to take over farm land from those willing to sell, develop it into layouts and offer half of the number of sites developed to farmers so that they can sell them to whoever they want. BUDA will, however, allocate its sites to those who apply for them, under government rates.
It has an on-going project on Kanabaragi Road that was challenged in court earlier. It has been cleared now and BUDA will develop the layout in 140 acres, excluding the 160 acres that is under dispute.
Similar plans are afoot in Jhadshahapur, Hindalga and Anagol villages. A few days ago, residents of Anagol and Halaga villages submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner’s office urging the government to drop the idea of creating residential layouts in these villages under farmers partnership scheme. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath has assured them of looking into their concerns."
105,"A day after the monsoon session of Parliament ended amid a flurry of protests by the Opposition over three farm Bills, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar demanded that the Congress first disassociate itself from its own 2019 poll manifesto that promised the same agricultural reforms as done by the Modi government. “If Rahul Gandhi agrees with the Congress manifesto of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then he should join efforts in educating farmers,” Mr. Tomar said.
Addressing a presser at the BJP headquarters here, Mr. Tomar reiterated the government’s commitment to farmers’ welfare and said the new measures would bring them remunerative price for their produce. He also said the government was open to holding talks with farmers to assuage any doubts among them on the efficacy of the reforms. “If any farmer wants to speak to any government representative on these Bills even at midnight, we are ready,” he said.
Responding to the demand by the Opposition that continuation of the minimum support price (MSP) should be mentioned in the law, he said the MSP was always an administrative decision. “Why did the Congress not bring a law during its 50 years of rule if it thinks this was necessary,” he asked. He also cited reports of various commissions and reported views of Sharad Pawar, who was Agriculture Minister in the UPA government, to assert that these Bills are in line with their recommendations.
‘Withdraw manifesto’
Asked about Mr. Gandhi’s charge that the Modi government had harmed farmers and was now doing “PR”, Mr. Tomar said the Congress leader should first withdraw his party’s manifesto if he wanted to oppose the Bills.
The new laws will allow farmers to get paid for their produce in advance, help them move products which will fetch them better price and allow them to sell their produce outside agriculture ‘mandis’ without paying any taxes, he said.
“Farmers, so far, were forced to sell their produce in mandis. In Punjab, there’s 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, through these Bills, the farmer will be able to sell his produce even outside the ambit of the mandi, even outside his State at any price he chooses,” Mr. Tomar said.
Parliament has passed the three farm reform Bills — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill — in the session, which concluded on Wednesday. They will become laws after getting the assent of President Ram Nath Kovind and being notified."
106,"Amidst strong indications about the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani set to align with the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the faction has suffered a major blow with senior party leader and three time legislator Joseph M. Puthussery quitting the party to join the rival faction led by P.J. Joseph.
Announcing the decision here on Thursday, Mr. Puthussery told media persons that he wanted to follow the political probity of K.M. Mani and those who followed the footsteps of the KC(M) patriarch could never align with the LDF.
“Even though Mr. Mani had severed ties with the UDF in 2016, he then chose to come back soon,” he said.
He further criticised the Mani group's decision to forge ties with the LDF, which had made K.M. Mani a target of political witch hunt during the bar bribery case. “Ironically, those who claim the legacy of K.M. Mani are joining hands with the LDF after his demise. This is going to be suicidal. People who love K.M. Mani are not going to accept it,” Mr. Puthussery said.
The move comes close on the heels of reports that the faction had already given the LDF a list of local body wards from where it wished to contest in the upcoming local body elections.
Responding to the allegations levelled by the estranged leader, party general secretary Stephen George said the reasons cited by Mr. Puthussery to quit the party were nothing but the justification of a fortune seeker. “In fact, it is Mr. Puthussery, who has now taken a suicidal move as the camp he joined belonged to those who are trying to destroy the party founded by K.M. Mani,” Mr. George said.
Meanwhile, Mani group leader N. Jayaraj, MLA, said the party was yet to initiate a discussion with regard to joining the LDF."

109,"New caution boards have come up on either side of Mayor Muthu Road Over Bridge (ROB) warning heavy vehicles with more than 10 tonnes of weight to avoid the structure connecting Periyar bus stand with southern parts of Madurai city.
Reason: the bridge has lost its designed stability due to lack of proper maintenance. The bridge is a vital connectivity on the all-important Tirupparankundram Road providing the shortest link for southern districts to Madurai railway junction and Meenakshi temple.
In a bid to safeguard the “weak structure”, the Highways Department has put up another caution board restricting the speed limit on the bridge to 30 kmph.
A cursory glance shows that the sub-structure of the bridge is in bad shape what with the outer plastering worn out in every pillar. The iron rods have remained exposed to open air in too many spots for very long and are rusted. Even as the plastering has peeled off in many spots for more than half-a-foot, fresh cracks on the pillars reveal the stress the substructure is undergoing.
Every hour, hundreds of heavy vehicles, including buses, light vehicles and two-wheelers use the bridge under which Madurai-Manamadurai railway track runs.
“The bridge is more than 45 years old and needs urgent attention to retore it to its normal health,” says former Chief Engineer, State Highways Department, A.K. Rajaduraivelpandian.
It is not an isolated case of Mayor Muthu Bridge alone, but many structures of its age in the State are facing the same problem, he points out. “These are vey old bridges and routine maintenance like plastering and colour washing will not serve the purpose.”
The bridges should get special attention. “Advanced scientific solutions are available and concrete mix should be injected with advanced machineries to restore their stability,” Mr. Pandian says.
He recalls that he drew the attention of the State government several years ago to the need for special maintenance of bridges. However, that did not get any positive response till date. “Spending a few crores on maintenance will increase the longevity of the bridge by at least 10 to 20 years.”
If not attended to immediately or not done in the proper manner, the bridge might need total replacement. The State Highways should create a separate wing for maintenance of bridges on the lines of railways.“There is a telling difference in the maintenance of the railway portion of the bridges and the approach roads [maintained by the State Highways],” he adds.
A senior Highways official says a proposal for major maintenance work at a cost of ₹5 crore is pending with the State government. “The work will be taken up as per the advice of IIT-Madras. Once the reinforcement is done, it will gain its old stability.”
Traffic police have been advised to divert heavy vehicles through Ellis Nagar ROB, he adds."
110,"The National Domestic Workers Movement on Thursday called for special legislation to protect the welfare and livelihoods of the work force across the country.
Addressing mediapersons, along with a group of domestic workers, P. Clara, State coordinator, emphasised their plight in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and said the movement held protests across the country on Thursday.
Many workers lost their livelihoods since the outbreak of the pandemic, as they were falsely perceived to be carriers of the viral infection, said Ms. Clara. “Many of the domestic workers are sole breadwinners of their families. With the loss of livelihood, many are unable to pay their rent or make ends meet. Only a few have resumed work.”
Hence, the government must provide a financial aid of ₹7,500 for each month from April to December to withstand the financial crisis caused by the pandemic.
Condemning the passage of three key labour bills in Parliament, she said they would undermine the security and livelihood of unorganised workers. “The government must ensure that social security schemes can be availed by domestic workers too.”"

113,"The CBI searched the premises of half a dozen former officials of KITCO and that of an outreach wing of an institution on Thursday in connection with the probe into the alleged misappropriation of the agency's CSR funds and a few other contracts involving the agency.
The raids were conducted in Kochi and Kottayam and on the premises of former senior officials of KITCO which is headquartered in Kochi. This was in connection with the probe into instances of alleged misappropriation of CSR funds which, according to the case, either did not reach the intended beneficiaries or did not serve the purpose for which the money was meant for. Former MD of the agency Cyriac Davis is arraigned as first accused, said a CBI official who was part of the search team.
Both the Central and State governments have stake in the consultancy agency. Among the alleged cases of fund misappropriation was one in which the agency engaged an outreach wing of an institution to train women in the Kuttampuzha tribal belt in bee keeping and making value-added products from bamboo reeds.
An official, who was associated with the implementation of the initiative and had been questioned by the CBI earlier, said that the project to handhold a few dozen women was implemented in 2015. The local body too was involved in the project, he said.
The project ran into controversy after Forest Department officials, under whose area it was implemented, feigned ignorance of the initiative. An RTI activist had alleged that KITCO officials misappropriated the bulk of funds which were meant to empower tribal women.
A probe is also under way into the alleged irregularities in identifying KITCO's head office and alleged erroneous design of an effluent treatment plant at Cochin SEZ, which led to leakage, necessitating intervention of the State Pollution Control Board. Mr. Davis was unavailable for comment.
A VACB probe had revealed that the agency’s slack supervision led to cracks surfacing on Palarivattom flyover within two years of its commissioning, following which a senior official was remanded."

121,"In a first of its kind initiative in the country, gram panchayats under the Pune Zilla Parishad have pooled underutilised health fund money to purchase 92 ambulances and firm up the rural health infrastructure amid the rise in COVID-19 cases.
Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad, said this is probably the first instance where the rural administration of a district has taken the lead in buying ambulances since such purchases usually fall under the domain of the State government.
A sarpanch of a gram panchayat told The Hindu, “Under the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions, a portion of funds allotted to gram panchayats under the rubric of ‘health’ was lying unutilised. Often, the gram panchayats don’t know where to use their ‘health’ money and generally expend them in local-level sanitary works like repairing drainage systems.”
Mr. Prasad, in an innovative move, directed purchases of ambulances to be made under Section 139 of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959. “The gram panchayats passed resolutions and then pooled in their money, with each contributing their share as a proportion of their population. After obtaining a ‘technical’ sanction from the State government, we went ahead with the purchases, which were made over the one-stop Government e-Marketplace hosted by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals, where common user goods and services can be procured,” he said.
Each ambulance, a TATA Winger van purchased at ₹14.22 lakh, is equipped with two portable oxygen cylinders of 2.2 litre capacity, Global Positioning System, auto-loading stretcher facility and storage space for first aid and nursing kits. The driver’s remuneration and the cost of fuel are to be borne by the Zilla Parishad from its cess funds, authorities said.
Mr. Prasad said, “At present, 51 of these ambulances have been purchased. The remaining 41 will be procured next week. Of the 82 ambulances purchased by the State government, 41 were designated for rural areas. However, only 28 of these were equipped to ferry COVID-19 patients. The addition of 92 ambulances will be a tremendous boost to the healthcare system in rural parts.”
The move is expected to significantly firm up the healthcare infrastructure in Pune Rural, which has witnessed a dramatic surge in cases in the past three weeks. With an average daily case surge of nearly 1,000, the region has reported around 15,000 active cases and more than 1,200 deaths.
“Many a time, patients in far-flung areas lack easy access to multi-specialty hospitals. Moreover, ambulances are not fully equipped to cater to the urgent needs of critical patients. We hope to eliminate these problems with this new fleet of ambulances,” said Mr. Prasad.
Pune Zilla Parishad authorities said once the COVID-19 cases dwindle, the vehicles would be converted into 102 ambulances in a permanent augmentation of the Pune’s rural healthcare infrastructure
This isn’t the first time that the Pune Zilla Parishad has come up with a novel solution amid the COVID-19 crisis. In April, it came up with another out-of-the-box solution: placing errant spouses in institutional quarantine to counter rising cases of domestic violence during the lockdown."

123,"Bengaluru lad K.L. Rahul showed little concern for allegiance to home, dismantling Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) with a sparkling unbeaten century for Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday. Rahul’s 69-ball 132, laced with 14 fours and seven sixes, propelled KXIP to a comfortable 97-run victory.
KXIP amassed 206 for three in 20 overs before skittling out RCB for 109 in 17 overs.
Rahul, a former RCB player, was in full flow while recording his second IPL century. He got going with two crisp square-cuts off Dale Steyn, which pierced the tight off-side field. Umesh Yadav was not spared either, with Rahul launching into the fast bowler in the 10th over.
Yuzvendra Chahal was the pick of the bowlers once again, but when the leg-spinner strayed on the pads, Rahul unleashed the sweep to good effect. The 28-year-old cut loose in the last three overs, smashing five sixes and three fours.
Quite uncharacteristically, RCB skipper Virat Kohli dropped two sitters in the deep. Rahul, the beneficiary on both occasions, could hardly believe his luck. The KXIP skipper ended up scoring more than half of his team’s total.
The RCB pacers, meanwhile, made life easy for KXIP. Umesh sprayed it down the leg much too often, while Steyn bowled too short and wide. Even Navdeep Saini, the team’s standout pacer, could not maintain a good length and was punished.
The slide begins
RCB’s troubles continued in a poor chase. The side lost three wickets in the first three overs, including that of key man Kohli.
Opener Devdutt Padikkal, who had shown much promise in the previous match, was cramped for room by left-arm seamer Sheldon Cottrell. The lefthander’s awkward pull sliced to Ravi Bishnoi at mid-on.
Young Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Philippe was trapped on the pads by Mohammed Shami for a duck.
The wicket of Kohli (1, 5b), who was dismissed in similar fashion to Padikkal, spelt big trouble for RCB.
Not enough
Aaron Finch (20, 21b) and A.B. de Villiers (28, 18b) tried to repair the damage, but their 49-run stand was grossly inadequate.
The rest of the contest drudged along without much purpose, as RCB was well and truly out of it.
Leggies Bishnoi and M. Ashwin picked up three wickets each for KXIP.
The Punjab side notched up its first win in two matches, while the Bengaluru outfit was humbled after a sparkling start to its campaign a few days earlier.

TIRUCHI: Members of the Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee and other outfits staged protests in various places across the Central region on Thursday opposing the farm bills brought in by the Central Government and demanded immediate withdrawal. The protesting members burnt copies of the bills at different places to display their stiff opposition and raised slogans against the Centre and the State government.
The protests by various outfits were held at various locations in Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Perambalur, Pudukottai and Tiruvarur districts. In Tiruchi city, a group of about 55 members of the Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee staged a protest near the central bus stand where they burnt some copies of the bill. They were led by the Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam president M.P. Chinnadurai. The protesting members were arrested by the police.
The protests by the Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee members in Thanjavur district were held in Thanjavur Town, Sengipatti, Budalur and Melaulur. The stir held near the Thanjavur railway junction was led by the Tamizh Desiya Periyakkam town secretary L. Ramasamy during which they burnt the copies of the bills and raised slogans demanding their withdrawal. About 40 members of the Viduthalai Tamizh Puligal Katchi led by its founder Kudanthai Arasan staged a road roko against the bills and burnt the copies of the bills leading to their arrest.
A group of farmers affiliated to the Cauvery Vivasayigal Paadhugaapu Sangam led by its district secretary Sundara Vimalanathan staged a demonstration near the Kumbakonam Head Post Office in Thanjavur district during which they demanded the Centre to withdraw the bills as it would affect the agricultural community. In Orathanadu in Thanjavur district, a group of members of the Vivasaya Paadhukaapur Sangam affiliated to the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi staged a protest and raised slogans against the Centre and the State government.
The Cauvery Rights Retrieval Committee members burnt copies of the bills as part of their protest at Mannargudi Town in Tiruvarur district. They alleged that the bills were aimed at supporting corporate houses and would affect the farming community. The protesters were led by the outfit's chief advisor Bharathiselvan. The functionaries of the Social Democratic Party of India resorted to protests on the same issue in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Thanjavur and in Tiruvarur.

127,"Thai lawmakers met Thursday to vote on six proposed amendments to the country’s military-backed constitution, as protesters pushing for charter reform gathered outside the Parliament building.
Changes to the constitution are one of three core demands that a coalition of protest groups has been seeking in recent months. The groups, which on Sunday held one of the biggest protest rallies in years, also want new elections and an end to intimidation of political activists, saying they are needed to strengthen democracy.
The protests, spearheaded by students, come as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s government faces broader criticism that it is ineffective and without direction as the economy sputters due to the knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government is also under pressure from some influential Thai royalists chagrined that the protesters are seeking unprecedented reforms to the monarchy, a sacrosanct institution to conservatives.
The current charter was written under the auspices of the military junta that took power after a 2014 coup and pushed it through in a referendum in which campaigning for a no vote was illegal. Prayuth led that coup, headed the military government and was named prime minister again after last year’s general election, held under the rules laid out by the new charter.
The constitution’s critics say its main aim was to secure the grip on power of the country’s traditional ruling elite - royalists, unelected bureaucrats and the military - by breaking that of political parties.
The constitution does not come from the people 100%, said Kanyakorn Suntornprug, a 20-year-old rallying outside Parliament. Even if in the past, it was not 100% democratic but at least there was some participation from the people.
The two-day debate on the amendments, which started Wednesday, is seen largely as an attempt to placate the protesters and ease pressure on the government. Voting by both houses of Parliament was expected to be completed late in the night.
While there is growing agreement that changes to the constitution are needed, there’s wide divergence over what those changes should be.
Key sections in dispute include the position and privileges of the monarchy - which protesters want to see redefined - and the role and powers of the unelected Senate.
The Senate’s 250 appointed members are seen as unequivocal backers of the present government and greatly influenced by the military. Most controversially, they are allowed to vote in the selection of a prime minister, a provision critics slam as fundamentally anti-democratic.
There are six proposals for charter amendment: one from Prime Minister Prayuth’s governing coalition and five from the opposition.
The one point both sides support is amending Section 256, which would establish a Constitution Drafting Assembly to write a new charter from scratch. The process could take as long as two years to complete.
However, it is unclear if enough senators would support the measure for it to pass, because voting on the amendments is conducted by a joint sitting of both houses. For any motion to pass it will need the support of at least a third of the senators, making victory uncertain even for the government’s draft supporting revision of Section 256.

131,"With the water level in the Idukki reservoir nearing the blue alert level on Thursday, a control room has been opened and arrangements made to monitor the situation.
Though rain has subsided, the inflow remained high with the water level in the dam reaching 2,387.04 ft. The blue alert level is 2,387.79 ft.
Though the present water level was below the rule curve level (2,395.79 ft) fixed by the Central Water Commission, the rise in the water level was attributed to the heavy rainfall two days back and low generation at the Moolamattom power house.
Usually, the generation level is lowered during the monsoon season.
According to the Dam Monitoring and Research Station at Vazhathoppe, the generation level was nearly 4.5 mu for the past three days. Though the water level is nearly 7 ft short of the red alert level, an official at the research station said the chances of opening the shutters of the reservoir were remote. The situation would change in the event of a heavy rainfall and power generation had to be raised to control the water level.
In case of an increase in water level, an orange alert will be sounded at 2,393.78 ft before the red alert at 2,394.79 ft. The full reservoir level is 2,404 ft.
Supriya S., KSEB chief engineer (Dam Safety and DRIP), on Thursday said the blue alert was marked as an internal alert system. “It is for advanced measures to be taken to prevent a sudden water release from a dam. With the rain subsiding, the inflow too will fall. The safety measures ensure the controlled release of water in case of a heavy rainfall,” she said.
Though the water level in the Pampa was flowing above the blue alert level, the inflow has come down on Thursday. At Kakki, the water level was much below the rule curve level, she added."

The police have registered an FIR and booked cases against 32 persons, including the father and the brother of the boy, for their alleged involvement in the case. However, the two were among the arrested seven persons.

Speaking at an all party meeting held here on Thursday he said that the political parties and the public forums could send representations to him to establish new polling booths. By taking into account of distance, terrain and other inconveniences, a decision will be taken. Necessary steps would be taken after inspecting the areas.

139,"Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi “God of farmers”, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said three farm sector reform bills passed recently by Parliament will double the income of cultivators.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday night, Mr. Chouhan termed those opposing the bills as “kisandrohi” (anti-farmers) and claimed they are doing so to protect the interest of middlemen.
“The Prime Minister, who is taking farsighted decisions, is God of farmers. All the three bills related to agriculture reforms are a blessing for farmers. These will double their income,” Mr. Chouhan said.
People opposing these bills are not well-wishers of farmers and are just misleading them, the BJP leader said.
“If any exporter, by paying a good price, purchases wheat and rice from farmers directly, then there will be no need for middlemen. Why are opposition parties supporting these middlemen?” he asked.
By crticising these bills, the opposition parties are not opposing the Prime Minister, but “blindly opposing” interests of farmers, the Chief Minister said.
The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 were passed in both the houses of Parliament amid protests from the opposition parties.
On Wednesday, 18 opposition parties urged President Ram Nath Kovind not to sign the contentious bills and alleged that they were passed “unconstitutionally” in “complete disregard” of parliamentary norms.
The Modi government has claimed these bills are to ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce without being subject to the regulations of mandis (agri markets).
Farmer organisations and the opposition parties allege that the law has been framed to suit “big corporates who seek to dominate the Indian food and agriculture business”, and will weaken the negotiating power of farmers."

They agreed to pay the amount a week after Sri Lanka’s Attorney General Dappula de Livera staked a claim of $1.8 million for the costs incurred on dousing the fire on board the Panama-registered tanker MT New Diamond on September 3.
Rajapaksa thanks defence personnel for fighting fire onboard MT New Diamond
New Diamond, a vessel under charter by the Indian Oil Corporation, was carrying 2,70,000 metric tonnes of crude oil from Mina Al Ahmadi port in Kuwait to the Indian port of Paradip when a boiler explosion in its engine room caused a fire off the coast of Sangamankanda in Ampara district.
A Filipino crew member died and another was injured in the incident. The Sri Lanka Navy with the help of Indian counterparts and coast guard doused the fire after great effort.
Sri Lankan navy plugs fuel leak on oil tanker
The New Diamond’s owners have told the Attorney General of their willingness to meet the interim claim. The Attorney General had ordered the police to record a statement from the captain of the ship.
The Colombo chief magistrate court later ordered the captain of the oil tanker to appear before the court on September 28.
He was to be charged for committing offences under the Marine Pollution Environmental Protection Act. The ship is currently in the seas 70 nautical miles east of Batticaloa in the east and 129 kilometres away from the Batticaloa coast. Two Sri Lankan Naval ships, one Indian Naval ship and three Indian coast guard vessels are currently deployed in the operations near the oil tanker.
Some five ships of Indian coast guard and one Indian Navy ship engaged in fire-fighting, the Sri Lanka Navy said early this month. The tanker had 23 crew members - 18 Filipinos and five Greeks. Twenty-two of the 23-member crew had been safely rescued off the tanker."
142,"Initial symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease happening due to the damaging of tissues that can lead to shortening of breath, have been noticed in a couple of people who recovered from COVID-19 here recently.
This was revealed by M. Shamsudeen, consultant physician attached to a Post-COVID Care Clinic at IQRAA Hospital in Kozhikode. The clinic has been set up jointly by the National Health Mission, Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, and the State government. The out-patient section here is open all days except Sunday from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
“The symptoms were found in two persons who came here for post-COVID check-up. One was in his 40s and the other in his 50s. Without losing time, they were given treatment. If they were late, it would have been difficult,” Dr. Shamsudeen said. He pointed out that fatigue, headache, body pain, breathlessness, and cough are some of the common after-effects found among those who had approached the clinic after recovering from COVID-19.
According to experts, almost 20% of people who got cured of the infection may develop future health problems. This includes asymptomatic people who were tested positive for the virus. It has been termed ‘post-COVID syndrome’ or ‘long COVID’. Paralysis, cardiac arrest, and epilepsy could be some of the consequences. Doctors at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences had earlier said that a majority of these patients might have conditions caused by other diseases. At least some of them may have to go for lung transplants, they had said.
Developed countries such as the United Kingdom has already begun ‘post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study’. It is a consortium of researches and clinicians from across that country “to understand and improve long-term health outcomes for patients who have been in hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.” In India, Delhi government is reported to have launched similar efforts.
Dr. Shamsudeen, however, noted that not many are aware of the importance of post-COVID care. “Those who have cough or breathing problems need to immediately seek medical treatment. Any negligence can be fatal,” he said. The clinic has three physicians and one pulmonologist."

145,"Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation’s new tourist attraction that faced hurdles over COVID-19 situation early this year is gearing up for a launch in Mysuru and Hampi, the State’s two major tourist destinations.
‘Ambari’, a specially-built double-decker bus for open-roof bus tours, is being launched in Mysuru during the low-key Dasara celebrations. The initiative's launch planned in March this year was put off in view of the pandemic.
With the festivities approaching, the KSTDC is now making preparations for rolling out the open-roof bus tours and ferrying tourists on the designated route to help them experience the beauty of Mysuru’s rich heritage on the go.
The KSTDC had requested the Forest Department and the Mysuru City Corporation to prune tree branches on the designated route for the smooth movement of the 16-ft.-tall bus.
The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation was also requested to raise its overhead electrical lines to facilitate hassle-free movement of the bus, and these works are expected to be done by Dasara. The 40-seater bus, with lower and upper decks, was built in Bengaluru.
KSTDC Regional Manager Uday Kumar told The Hindu that the CESC is expected to commence the work soon while the MCC and the Forest Department are already on the job. “All of them have assured us to get the things done soon so that we can start our trial run before we officially roll out the buses,” he added.
The COVID-19 situation had put brakes on the KSTDC’s plan of launching ‘Ambari’ in March this year and one such bus that arrived here from Bengaluru for the launch had to be parked in the KSTDC office premises awaiting the run.
Once the preparations are done for the launch, three other ‘Ambari’ buses are also expected to be operated depending on the prevailing situation and the response to the new attraction. Besides four ‘Ambari’ buses to Mysuru, two buses will be operated in Hampi.
“The route and other logistics are being worked out for the Hampi tour which may also take off this year,” he said.
Ambari is a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to experience the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists will get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages in the beginning — Kannada and English. Foreign languages will be added subsequently.
The body wrapping of ‘Ambari’ had been done based on the State’s art forms, culture and diversity, wildlife, and tourist destinations."
146,"Stating the three bills on agriculture passed in Parliament will benefit only corporate companies, Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK) general secretary E.R. Eswaran has said that implementation of the new laws will lead to more farmer suicides in the country.
In a press release, he said that Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, will affect small and marginal farmers.
They will be forced to enter into agreement with corporate companies and sell their produce at a price fixed by the companies. Small and marginal farmers cannot market their produce across the country and retail traders will benefit a lot. The release said that only companies can stock the farm produce which will ultimately lead to price control mechanisms falling under private hands.
“Attempts are made to project these laws will increase the income level of farmers which is untrue”, he said and added that the Centre should have consulted the State governments and farmers before introducing the bills. He said that the government had advertised that demonetisation and introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) had benefited the people. “But, there is no doubt that it had a negative impact on the people”, he added."
147,"Karnataka Legislative Assembly Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri on Thursday admitted a notice on no-confidence motion given by the principal Opposition Congress against the BJP government in Karnataka.
The Speaker informed the Assembly that he would allot time on Friday or Saturday for a discussion on the no-trust notice signed by 23 Congress members.
As soon as the House met after paying rich tributes to Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, who succumbed to COVID-19, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah raised the issue of notice on non-confidence motion and said the State government has lost confidence of the House and urged the Speaker to give a priority for debate on the no-trust motion.
“When the House has no confidence in the government, how will you continue”, Mr. Siddaramaiah said and demanded the Speaker to take up the no confidence motion discussion first before taking any other issues.
Countering the claims made by Mr. Siddaramaiah, Revenue Minister R Ashok said the Congress has no mandate in the state as well as in the country. “The notice on non-trust motion is nothing but political gimmick”, he said.
The government has majority and it was ready to prove majority in the House. But many members of the Congress already quit the party and many would quit soon. “We don’t know how many will remain in the Congress”, Mr. Ashok said.
When Mr. Askok stood up to table Bills, H K Patil (Congress) said the government should not be allowed to table bills after the Speaker admitted the notice on non-trust motion. Mr. Kageri termed Mr. Patil’s suggestion as his personal view and allowed Mr. Ashok table two bills in the House.
CLP meeting
Earlier, M.r Siddaramaiah chaired a meeting of the Congress Legislator’s Party (CLP) and decided to move the no-confidence motion against the government. He claimed that the government has lost people’s confidence and alleged that family members of Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa were indulged in corruption.
Speaking to mediapersons, the Congress leader alleged that the corruption was rampant in the purchase of equipment related to COVID-19 and purchase of laptops. There was no transparency in the administration. The Chief Minister’s son Vijendra has been interfering the administration. While the financial condition of the State has gone for a toss, the development works have come to a standstill in the State, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged.
D. K. Shivakumar, who is also the KPCC president, spoke about corruption in the government and said the party was serious in moving the no-trust vote against the government.
It is stated that AICC General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala suggested the state party leaders to move the no confidence motion against the government. On Wednesday, Mr. Surjewala alleged about corruption in the Yediyurappa government and sought the Chief Minister’s resignation."

151,"Following repeated incidents of man-elephant conflict in parts of Hassan district, the district-level officers of the Forest Department have written to the department seeking permission to radio-collar four more elephants and capture two problematic elephants. So far, four elephants have been radio-collared; however, equipment installed on three animals have stopped responding.
More than 60 elephants spread over four-five groups have been roaming around areas of Sakleshpur, Yeslur and Alur forest ranges of Hassan district. Every day, farmers complain to the Forest Department of crop damage due to the movement of the herds. A priest died on September 1 at Kollahalli near Sakleshpur, while he was near his house. Such incidents have forced the growers to put pressure on the State government demanding a permanent solution to the problem. They have urged the government to capture all elephants roaming in the area.
The rapid response teams formed by the Forest Department keep track of herds’ movement and alert local people so that man-elephant conflicts could be avoided. However, this exercise does not help in bringing down the instances of crop damage. The farmers cannot visit their farms for several days as the herds roam there. B.R. Manjunath, a planter at Ballupete, said the farmers had been losing patience over the repeated incidents of crop damage. “We don’t know how to protect our crops. If a coffee plant is lost due to elephants, the government pays ₹200 as compensation. But, we have spent years to grow it. How long the growers should tolerate this?”, he asked. Like him, many have conveyed their problems to the Forest Department.
Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu that he was aware of the problems faced by the growers. “We are doing what best can be done. Right now four elephants are radio-collared. We have to replace the batteries of three instruments. Besides that, I have written to the department to conduct an operation to radio-collar four more. Once it is done, we will be tracking the movement of eight elephants so that location of herds could be tracked easily”, he said.
Similarly, the department has also identified two elephants for capture and relocation. “Considering their behaviour, we have identified two tuskers for capture. The operation will be done once rains stop”, he added."
152,"Gupteshwar Pandey, the tough-talking IPS officer who stepped down as Bihar police chief late Tuesday night, hogged media limelight a day after and dropped hints about joining politics, asserting he is a “free man” now and that contesting elections is not illegal.
The voluble former top cop of the state was chased and courted by national television through the day but what they succeeded in wangling out of him for now was that he is still not a political person, but being a “free man” now, he could join politics if people want him to do so.
“I am now a free citizen of India like you. I am no longer the DGP. So, no service rules apply to me anymore.
Thousands of people are coming from Buxar, Begusarai, Jehanabad, Aurangabad and other districts. I will take a decision after talking to them. Contesting elections is not illegal,” he told journalists.
The assertive officer is often called ‘Robinhood Pandey’ by his band of supporters.
Mr. Pandey, who had come in for criticism from politicians in Maharashtra for strongly pleading for a CBI probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, however, said he was “exasperated” at suggestions that he did so because of his political ambitions.
“I have spent more than three decades in (police) service and nobody can raise a finger at my professional integrity. But, in the recent past, thousands of calls and messages seeking to know when I am entering politics, which party I am planning to join.....left me exasperated,” Mr. Pandey said.
When journalists persisted with questions about whether he has plans to join politics, he said, “I have neither joined any political party nor I am a political person till now. When I join (a party), I will tell all of you before I do.
“Politics is not the only way of serving society. One can work for society in different ways even without joining politics.”
Mr. Pandey, a daring IPS officer known for his rustic mannerisms, had sought voluntary retirement in 2009 amid speculation that he wanted to contest the Lok Sabha election from Buxar. It was rumoured that the BJP wanted to field him from the seat which has substantial Brahmin votes.
The saffron party changed its mind and did not field Mr. Pandey.
In a rare concession by a state government for an IPS officer who had voluntarily quit service, the ruling dispensation in Bihar sat over his resignation for nine months and then reinstated him.
The officer, at whose suggestion, the Bihar government had recommended a CBI probe into the death of Patna-born actor Sushant Singh Rajput in Mumbai, rubbished suggestions that his outspokenness in the case was in anyway linked to his political ambitions.
The officer had virtually waged an all-out war with Maharashtra politicians on national television in support of a CBI investigation in Rajput’s death case, asserting that it alone could do “justice” to the deceased actor.
In line of Shiv Sena fire, Mr. Pandey, who has a fan following among a section of the youth in Bihar, was unflappable, and declared he will do everything to get the actor justice.
The VRS request of Mr. Pandey, who would have retired in February 2021, was accepted by Governor Phagu Chauhan on Tuesday, the day he tendered his resignation.
“The Bihar DGP who was used for this defamation is being blatantly rewarded. His voluntary retirement says it all,” said Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant in Mumbai, reacting to reports that Pandey could take the political plunge.
While a government officer has to give three months’ notice before resigning, Mr. Pandey’s resignation was accepted immediately, he said.
Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut, with whom Mr. Pandey had locked horns over the issue of a CBI probe in Rajput’s death case, also claimed the former Bihar DGP was being “rewarded” for speaking against Mumbai and Maharashtra.
Mr. Pandey, who had said actress Rhea Chakraborth had no ’aukaat’ (stature) to comment on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s decision to recommend a CBI probe in the case, defended his statement.
“Someone who is an accused in the case and named in an FIR for hatching a conspiracy to kill Sushant Singh Rajput has no right to make any comment against a person who is occupying a constitutional post,” Mr. Pandey said.
Bihar’s ruling JD(U) preferred silence on Mr. Pandey seeking voluntary retirement or his political ambition, ally BJP said everyone has the right to lead a social and political life in a democratic set up.
“Gupteshwar Pandey jee had joined the service on his own sweet will and has now opted for VRS. There is no scope left for a political party to make any suggestion about what he should do. He has every right to choose a political party or ideology he wants to pursue,” state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said."

156,"A political slugfest appears to be on the cards as the Bharatiya Janata Party government in the State has tabled an eight-and-half-year-old report on the “misuse and encroachment” of Wakf properties before the State legislature.
The report. readied on March 23, 2012, by the then chairman of the Karnataka State Minorities Commission Anwar Manippady has kicked up political dust afresh as it names several prominent politicians, particularly those in the Congress, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Dharam Singh, Rehman Khan, Jaffer Sharief, MLAs Khaneer Fathima Qamur-ul-Islam, N.A. Haris, his wife Tahera Haris and mother Suraiah Mohammed, as those among the ones responsible for “misuse and encroachment” of Wakf properties.
Others who have been named in the report include MLA Roshan Baig, former Union Minister C. Ibrahim, former Ministers Qamur-ul-Islam and Hindasgeri, former MP Narasing Rao Suryavamshi and former MLAs Iqbal Ansari and Syed Yasin.
The tabling coincides with the Opposition mounting its attack on the government over several issues including the charges of corruption and improper handling of the COVID-19 situation.
The report, which has listed encroachment as well as misuse of properties in each of the districts, says that 1,803 acres of the total 2,586 acres in Bidar alone have been encroached.
The report has described the “massive” encroachment and misappropriation as “only the tip of the iceberg.” Alleging that “Wakf mafia” has joined hands with Wakf Board in the scam, it has observed that the volume of the scam is not smaller than 2-G scam that rocked the country earlier.
It has recommended to the government to take the Wakf Board into its control and begin the task of cleansing it. It has recommended that an inquiry should be conducted through the Lokayukta besides initiating legal process by suspending the Wakf Committee for a year.

159,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday took suo moto cognizance of the building collapse in Bhiwandi in Thane and said, “it is a very serious incident”, where 41 were declared dead and 25 rescued by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).
A Division Bench of Chief Justice (CJ) Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni was hearing a matte related to a construction in Kalyan Dombivali and the CJ remarked, the incident in Bhiwandi was very serious.
The 43-year-old Jilani building in the powerloom town is around 10 km from Thane. The three-storey structure had 40 flats and 150 people were living there.
The court said, “A building has collapsed in Bhiwandi, several lives have been lost. We are told the situation is quite serious in Mumbai too.”
Taking suo moto cognizance of the same, the court made the State of Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and the civic bodies of Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Kalyan-Dombivali, Thane and Navi Mumbai as respondents in the case.
Serves notice 
The court issued notices to the State and all municipal corporations and directed Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to ensure that all the parties file their reply in two weeks.
Mr. Kumbhakoni said, “We will file our replies detailing what has been done so far across the State for such buildings and measures taken, as well as the steps we propose to take in future.”

“A part of the collection is called Lounge Away and has been designed keeping in mind the current period. We believe fashion has to adapt to the changing times and our latest collection embodies elegance and functionality,” says Abraham, adding, “We felt it was important for our clients to know the line was something they could enjoy, even though our lives have changed so much in the past few months.”
“Ffolio will be the main destination for our collection in Bengaluru,” adds Abraham.
“I believe Abraham & Thakore are one of India’s leading designers right now as they have understood the importance of using Indian textiles and techniques to create a global product,” says stylist and choreographer Prasad Bidapa who will be launching the collection along with Yashodhara Shroff, founder of Ffolio. “That is the way ahead for handloom and khadi in our country as designers utilise them to generate employment and establish prosperity across the board.”
“The move to a more central location as well as to a landmark store in the city is an important one for Abraham & Thakore,” says Bidapa, who will be styling a couple of ladies in various looks with the outfits from the collection at the event. “The clothes, which are handmade are beautiful with hand-finished embroidery on textiles that celebrate what India is all about.”

Advocate Pradeep Thorat, for Mr. Raut, and senior advocate Anil Sakhare, appearing for Mr. Late, sought time before a Division Bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla to file their replies.
Mr. Thorat said he needed time to file an affidavit as Mr. Raut, being an MP, is in Delhi. The Bench, however, made a remark on the BMC seeking time to reply. “You need more time here but otherwise you are very fast [in demolishing],” it said.
While allowing them time to do so, the court said, “since 40% of the Petitioner’s [Ms. Ranaut] Bungalow is already demolished on 9th September, 2020 and the Bungalow continues to stand in partially demolished condition since then, it is likely that some mishap may be caused due to the heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest.”
The Bench thus directed senior advocate Birendra Saraf, representing the actor, to commence his arguments on September 25 at 3 p.m.
On September 9, the BMC undertook a drive to demolish the alleged illegal portions of Ms. Ranaut’s office. Soon thereafter, the court directed the BMC to stay the process of demolition.
A ‘stop work’ notice was issued by the BMC on September 8 under Section 354A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act (power of Designated Officer to stop erection of building or work commenced or carried on unlawfully) was issued to Ms. Ranaut on September 8 pertaining to substantial alterations and additions carried out unlawfully."

Vodafone and India's finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The tax dispute stems from Vodafone's acquisition of the Indian mobile assets from Hutchison Whampoa in 2007. The government said Vodafone was liable to pay taxes on the acquisition, which the company contested.
In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the telecom provider but the government later that year changed the rules to enable it to tax deals that had already been concluded.
In April 2014, Vodafone initiated arbitration proceedings against India.

The health department has launched an in-depth analysis of the case.
Savio was working as a service supervisor with an event management firm in Oman when he was infected first.
“I tested positive in March after I got infected from a colleague who visited China. I was admitted to a private hospital in Muscat with complaints of chest pain and breathing difficulty. I was discharged after a week,” he said.
He returned to the state in June with the pandemic situation worsening in Oman. In July, he tested positive for the virus again. He was admitted to Thrissur medical college Hospital on July 22 and discharged on August 11. However, he tested positive again after two weeks. He was readmitted to the hospital on September 5 and discharged on September 11 based on a negative antigen test.

Bihar polls in 3 phases from Oct 28, counting on Nov 10
The Election Commission on Friday announced the schedule for Bihar assembly elections. The polls will be held in 3 phases on October 28, November 3 and November 7. The counting of votes will take place on November 10, CEC Sunil Arora said announcing the schedule.
Covid-19: Active cases fall but positivity rises
The seven-day rolling average growth rate in active cases of Covid-19 in India has slipped into the negative helped by recoveries exceeding daily new cases for last six consecutive days, indicating a decline in the actual caseload of the infection, even as a drop in average of daily tests through the week has raised concerns. The seven-day average growth rate in active cases was -0.6% for the September 17-23 period.
Healthcare experts, however, dismissed chances of a reinfection. ""It could be a case of false positive or viral litter and it might not be infectious. We need a detailed analysis,"" said Dr B Ekbal who heads the state-level experts' committee.
Health secretary Rajan N Khobragade said the department has decided to go in for an in-depth analysis as such an incident has not been reported anywhere so far. Thrissur district medical officer Dr K J Reena also refused to confirm a repeated virus infection. ""Also, we don’t know the youth's infection details in the Gulf. In some cases, the presence of virus is shown in RTPCR tests for over four months,"" she said.
Savio said he had been suffering breathing difficulty ever since he was infected first. ""I need to undergo a shoulder surgery and for that I need an RT-PCR negative certificate. Also, I will need an internationally recognised Covid-19 certificate to go abroad for a job,"" he said. Dr Sajith Kumar, department of infectious diseases, Kottayam medical college, said there is no 100% accuracy in Covid-19 negative certificates. ""However, there is no chance of a repeated virus infection. He should conduct an RT-PCR test and move on,"" he said.

Dr Reena said they needed a state government directive to conduct an antibody test in Savio. A health official, meanwhile, said they had recommended an antibody test after the youth tested positive for the virus twice but higher officials turned down the request. ICMR guidelines clearly state that all symptomatic Covid suspects who test antigen negative need to be retested using RT-PCR.
The repeated infections have, meanwhile, affected Savio's family and social life. ""My wife gave birth to twin daughters in Kozhikode in April but I haven't visited them so far. I'm leading an isolated life,"" he said."

The seven-day average growth rate in active cases was -0.6% for the September 17-23 period.
Observing that disengagement was a “complex” affair which would ultimately involve two armies moving back to permanent positions on their own side of the LAC, Srivastava said, “Even as two sides work towards complete disengagement in all friction areas, it is at the same time also necessary to ensure stability on the ground. The latest senior commanders’ meeting should be seen in all this overall context.”
Srivastava insisted the process had to be “reciprocal” — that Indians would move once the Chinese did so. India has said that the root of the current stand-off was the unusually large build-up and amassing of troops by the Chinese in contravention of existing agreements.
The commanders meeting expanded the discussion on disengagement to “all friction areas” apart from just Pangong Tso. The Chinese side, according to reports, wanted to confine the discussions to the southern bank of Pangong Tso, an area where Indian troops have acquired dominance over crucial ridges and heights.
At the foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow, S Jaishankar had insisted, and the point was accepted by the Chinese side, “that the two sides should continue the dialogue and quickly and comprehensively disengage in all the friction areas”."

Kohli felt had he not dropped Rahul, who remained unbeaten on 132, twice KXIP would not have been able to go past the 200-run mark.
""I have to stand in front and take the brunt of it, not the best day in the office, couple of important chances of KL when he was set and that cost us 35-40 runs at a later stage.

181,"NEW DELHI: The NDA ally, Lok Janshakti Party, has claimed their chief Chirag Paswan may contest the assembly election in Bihar as the party is keen to project him as the chief minister face in the state.
“Our party strongly believes that the CM should be elected directly by people and not by selection. If you are not elected by people, you won’t get the feedback from the ground. So far there has been no discussion among partners about seat sharing. As we are losing more days, our Plan-B to put candidates against all JD(U) candidates is actually becoming Plan A. We are prepared to give a tough fight,” said an LJP leader in condition of anonymity.
Political circles were seeing this as another sign of LJP's feud with Bihar CM minister Nitish Kumar whom NDA has projected as their choice for the top job in the state, with ""election versus selection"" formulation appearing to be a jibe trained at the JD(U) boss who is a member of the Legislative Council.
While the ties between LJP and JDU have almost snapped, Paswan has tried to be on the right side of the BJP.
The BJP, for its part, reciprocated the sentiment but has rejected LJP’s insistence not to project Nitish as CM, with all party leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi downwards declaring the incumbent as their mascot for the polls.
LJP 's patience seems to be running thin also because BJP is unlikely to be very generous in allotting seats for Ramvilas Paswan’s party to contest.
Sources said the regional party from Bihar would write to the BJP to get a clear picture about the alliance and seat sharing so that it can start preparation. “Our candidates also need time for poll preparation. We don’t know what the BJP has to offer to us,” said another leader.
Meanwhile, after some JD(U) leaders threw a challenge to the LJP chief to contest election without being in alliance with BJP, Chirag's colleagues hit back saying JD(U) is also dependent on BJP for survival and would receive a rude shock, if it were to go to the hustings on its own. “They will receive the biggest blow. They are depending highly on BJP and PM Narendra Modi’s popularity and decisions,” two LJP leaders told TOI."

Coffee Day had earlier sought a price of Rs 3,000 crore for the vending machine business, but lowered it later in light of the unit (corporate customers account for bulk of the business) being hit by office attendance rules triggered by Covid-19. The group will have to demerge the vending machine business from Coffee Day Global and then sell to the potential acquirer as the company houses other retail businesses too.
The potential deal comes as Tata Consumer plans to ramp up its food and beverage portfolio. It had recently acquired the packaged products unit of sister concern Tata Chemicals. It also runs a coffee chain in partnership with Starbucks. “The Tatas have the supply chain and raw material in place for the coffee business because of their plantations. In the meanwhile, they have gained significant experience on the retail side because of their association with Starbucks,” said Arvind Singhal, founder of retail consultancy, Technopak. “There is an opportunity in the country for this business, and the Tatas can do justice to it due to their expertise and financial muscle — the latter was missing from Coffee Day.”"

Covid-19: Active cases fall but positivity rises
The seven-day rolling average growth rate in active cases of Covid-19 in India has slipped into the negative helped by recoveries exceeding daily new cases for last six consecutive days, indicating a decline in the actual caseload of the infection, even as a drop in average of daily tests through the week has raised concerns. The seven-day average growth rate in active cases was -0.6% for the September 17-23 period.
As a startto the 3rd chapter of Beat Heart Failure, TOI reached out to policymakers and the best medical minds of Assam to de-mystify the disease.
The campaign’s Assam edition saw the participation of state health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, cardiology professor at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital Pranab Jyoti Bhattacharyya, cardiologist at Apollo Hospitals, Guwahati, Rituparna Baruah, chief interventional cardiologist at Hayat Super Speciality Hospital Chinmoy Mazumdar, state director of medical education Anup Kumar Barman and programme officer of non-communicable diseases at the National Health Mission Rahul Sarma.

“Assam has a number of programmes to address heart failure, including correcting coronary heart disease among children. The state spends 6% of its GDP on health, and provides free treatment to patients through mechanisms like Atal Amrit Abhiyan, an insurance scheme for people who are not covered under PM-JAY,” said health minister Sarma. “We are studying the heart failure registry of Kerala. If we find it feasible for use here, we will emulate it. Early detection is key to treating heart failure.”
The misconceptions around heart failure are many, said Barman, adding that not only was heart failure prevalent, it was one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.
Bhattacharyya said heart failure could be caused by heart disease as well as other diseases.
“Anaemia is a very big cause of heart failure. Other risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, smoking, unhealthy lifestyle and untimely eating habits,” he explained, while stressing on the need for early detection of the disease to cut down on treatment cost. One of the ways in which heart failure can be detected in a cost-effective and timely manner is through screening of the disease.

Sarma, who said he was seeing younger and younger patients getting diagnosed with heart failure, said current screening programmes — which check people for diabetes, hypertension and various types of cancer — should also look for heart failure. “With this, there needs to be a referral system so that critically ill patients can be referred to tertiary healthcare centres,” he said.
Mazumdar explained that a heart failure patient could be symptomatic and asymptomatic, making detection difficult.
“Heart failure could be incipient or of sudden onset. One way of checking people for heart failure is by making them fill a simple questionnaire. Grassroots health workers and primary physicians could be roped in for this,” Mazumdar said.
Baruah echoed the sentiment. “The symptoms of a heart attack and heart failure can overlap. In such cases, it is very important to have a questionnaire that can be accessible to patients. We can start looking for heart disease by getting patients to check for symptoms like fatigue and breathlessnes,"" said the cardiologist."

185,"AMARAVATI: With the markets slowly opening up across the globe, demand for dry chilli in the international market has shot up, resulting in an increase in prices. The high quality chilli Teja variety is fetching around Rs 17,000-18,000 per quintal while other common varieties too are getting a good price of over Rs 12,000-14,000 per quintal.
Sources said that the price in the local markets was escalating thanks to the good export orders. The chilli prices were just around Rs 8,000-10,000 per quintal during the peak season before lockdown and they dipped to around Rs 6,000 per quintal due to the lockdown.
Majority of the growers sold their stocks to the merchants and their middlemen after seeing the prices nose diving during the lockdown. Sources said that around 20 per cent of the farmers kept their stocks in the cold-storages after the merchants assured them of getting reasonably good prices after the lockdown.
As anticipated by the traders, the prices started shooting up in the last 2-3 weeks.
The prices touched an all-time high of Rs 18,000 per quintal in the last two days. Sources said that about 30-40 lakh bags of stock is still parked in the cold-storages which might give decent profits to the traders. “Teja and Byadigi varieties are commanding good prices due to the demand from exporters. The prices are relatively high,” said L Kranti Sekhar, a leading chilli trader.
Commission agents association former secretary Suresh Reddy said that production loss in some of the northern states due to the sudden floods and heavy rains has triggered the prices in the local markets. He said that common varieties too were fetching around Rs 100-120 per kg which is almost 40-50 per cent increase from the lockdown period. He said that there was a demand from other states in view of the festive season.
Guntur agriculture market committee chairman Ch Yesurathnam said that they were allowing the sale of the stocks even at the cold-storage points to ease the traffic congestion in the market yard.
He said that the decision to operate market near cold-storages had also helped farmers gain good prices. About 40,000 bags per day were being transacted at the market yard which is also very high during September."
186,"When two brothers fell critically ill with Covid-19 around the same time in March, their doctors were baffled. Both were young -- 29 and 31 years old -- and healthy. Yet within days they couldn’t breathe on their own and, tragically, one of them died.
Two weeks later, when a second pair of Covid-stricken brothers, both in their 20s, also appeared in the Netherlands, geneticists were called in to investigate. What they uncovered was a path leading from severe cases, genetic variations, and gender differences to a loss of immune function that may ultimately yield a new approach to treating thousands of coronavirus patients.
How long before you can get a Covid-19 vaccine?

The common thread in the research is the lack of a substance called interferon that helps orchestrate the body’s defense against viral pathogens and can be infused to treat conditions such as infectious hepatitis. Now, increasing evidence suggests that a significant minority of Covid-19 patients get very ill because of an impairedinterferon response. Twin landmark studies published Thursday in the journal Science showed that insufficient interferon may lurk at a dangerous turning point in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Legendary playback singer SP Balasubrahmanyam, popularly known as Balu and SPB, who enthralled millions of people with his youthful voice, died at 1.04 pm on Friday while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a Chennai hospital. He was 74. SPB, who sang more than 40,000 songs in a career spanning nearly 55 years, had been undergoing treatment in MGM Healthcare since August 5.
From labs to syringes: How a Covid-19 vaccine will reach you

“It looks like this virus has one big trick,” said Shane Crotty, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. “That big trick is to avoid the initial innate immune response for a significant period of time and, in particular, avoid an early type-1 interferon response.”
The work highlights the potential for interferon-based therapies to enlarge a slowly accumulating range of Covid-19 treatments. These include Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and convalescent plasma, a component of the blood of recovered patients that may contain beneficial immune factors.
These treatments provide limited benefit and are typically used in very sick, hospitalized patients. The possibility that interferon may help some people is enticing because it appears most efficacious in the early stages of infection, when life-threatening respiratory failure could still be averted. Dozens of studies of interferon treatment are now recruiting Covid-19 patients.
“We think timing may be essential because it’s only in the very early phase one can really battle the virus particles and defend against infection,” said Alexander Hoischen, head of the genomic technologies and immuno-genomics group at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen that analyzed the DNA of the two sets of brothers.
Being male, elderly, and having underlying medical conditions can all raise patients’ risk of life-threatening Covid-19. But even within these groups, disease severity varies widely. Scientists have speculated other factors influence susceptibility, including pre-existing levels of inflammation and immunity, the amount of virus that starts an infection, and patients’ genetic makeup.
New nexus
Interferon’s role represents a new nexus in Covid-19’s complex interaction with the human immune system. Many patients suffer their worst complications because of an immune overreaction sometimes called a cytokine storm, and may benefit from dexamethasone, a cheap generic that calms these storms.
“It’s a very interesting disease because too little immunity is no good,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sept. 10 in an on-line briefing for Massachusetts General Hospital staff. “Too much immunity is really, really bad.”
Whether sufficient interferon is available early or late in Covid-19 cases has a major bearing on disease severity, according to Yuen Kwok-Yung, chair of infectious diseases in the University of Hong Kong’s department of microbiology. Ideally, production of the antiviral substance would be triggered when immune cells encounter SARS-CoV-2 genetic material, stopping rapid viral reproduction inside the body and averting complications, he said.
“But the SARS-CoV-2 virus has anti-interferon genes which can stop or antagonize the production or effect of interferon,” said Yuen, who measured the effects in human lung tissue. If the interferon response is delayed and the amount of virus in the body peaks at a high level, other parts of the immune system will be “awakened.”
‘Really disastrous’
That may trigger lung-injuring inflammation -- collateral damage from an excessive immune reaction to the virus. “This is really disastrous,” he said.
Some people are known to have trouble fighting infections because they make antibodies that deactivate their own interferon. On Thursday, a global consortium of researchers said such immune reactions to the protein could account for life-threatening Covid-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6% of women and 12.5% of men.
Interferon-blocking antibodies appeared in 101 of 987 patients with severe disease, but none of 663 people with an asymptomatic or mild case, according to the study in Science. Patients over age 65 were also more likely than younger ones to have the autoimmune abnormality, which was “clinically silent until the patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2,” the group of more than 100 scientists said.
‘First explanation’
“These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening Covid-19 and the increase in risk with age,” the researchers led by Jean-Laurent Casanova, head of Rockefeller University’s St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases in New York said. “They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening Covid-19.”
Genetic analysis of Covid-19 patients published in the same journal revealed two dozen gene mutations that had been “silent” until patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Researchers -- many of them also involved in the antibody study -- sequenced the genomes of 659 patients with life-threatening cases of the disease; 3.5% carried genetic variations that inhibit interferon production.
Those genetic flaws were similar to the ones that Hoischen and his colleagues from a dozen Dutch centers described in the Journal of the American Medical Association two months ago. The two sets of brothers had inherited a gene mutation that impaired the interferon response, keeping their immune systems from fighting the coronavirus until it had replicated for days.
In the Dutch men, the effects were cruel. The first, a young father from a town in the southern Netherlands, suffered shortness of breath, cough and fever at home for eight days before admission to intensive care. He was to spend 33 days in the hospital, 10 of them on a ventilator.
Raging fever
His 29-year-old brother succumbed to Covid-19 in an intensive care unit in Rotterdam, after being treated for shock and a fever that soared to 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit). When doctors at Radboud learned of his younger sibling’s case, as well as a second pair -- 21- and 23-year-old brothers also in respiratory failure -- they went looking for a genetic cause.
They found a mutation that was carried on the X chromosome. Defects on this chromosome are more likely to affect men, who have only one copy, while women have two.
The men’s mutations are rare -- occurring in 1 in 10,000 people -- and an unlikely explanation for the vast majority of severe Covid-19 cases. But the studies in Science indicate that various forms of interferon dysfunction may underlie as many as 14% of critical patients, and that screening and targeted treatment might prevent severe illnesses and deaths.
“If we manage to get them into our university medical center early enough,” Hoischen said, “our clinicians may be able to treat them with interferons.”

Other ways of overcoming autoimmunity, like the removal of antibodies against interferon from the blood, called plasmapheresis, could also help patients. On the other hand, patients who produce antibodies against interferon shouldn’t donate blood products for treating other patients.
“The rare diseases and the more common forms of the same disease may converge, and we can learn from each other,” said Hoischen. “That’s the hope.”"
187,"NEW DELHI: Contrary to some media reports suggesting that England all-rounder Ben Stokes will join Rajasthan Royals at the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) in the first week of October, former England left-arm spinner Monty Panesar feels the talismanic all-rounder perhaps won't be able to play this edition of the IPL. Panesar, though, has still picked the Royals as ""the most dangerous"" team of the season that began in the UAE on September 19.

Stokes, arguably the best all-rounder currently, is in Christchurch, New Zealand, to attend to his ailing father, who was diagnosed with brain cancer. He left the England team during the Test series against Pakistan at home last month and is yet to join his IPL franchise.
""With Ben Stokes, the situation is that his father is not in a good space. For that reason, he will probably be in New Zealand and I doubt he will be coming to the IPL,"" said Panesar talking to Timesofindia.com.

Ben Stokes may miss first part of IPL; Royals 'will wait' to hear from their all-rounder

Calling him the ""Superman of cricket"", Panesar said should Stokes manage to join the Royals at some stage, it will be ""massive"" for the tournament.
""He is a huge influence player, one of the key players with all-round abilities, dubbed the 'Superman of cricket'. I think his presence in the IPL will be massive,"" said Panesar, who played 50 Tests for England, about the hero of England's 2019 World Cup triumph.
While Stokes' absence leaves a huge void in the Royals' camp, Panesar thinks they are still the ""most dangerous"" among the eight teams and have the ability to turn a game on its head.
""The team that looks the most dangerous (and can) win from different situations, I would probably say it's the Rajasthan Royals,"" said Panesar.

The season has already seen targets in excess of 200 being set twice, by Rajasthan and Kings XI Punjab, despite expectations at the start of the tournament that the pitches in the Emirates will be slow and low and produce totals around the 140-160 mark. On that note, Panesar cautions about ignoring the seamers.
""IPL is always going to have spinners involved, but I think the seamers will have a bit of a role to play this time around,"" said the 38-year-old Panesar. ""With the nature of the pitches (grass left on it by curators), it skids on a little bit, there's more pace in there and it kind of moves a little bit as well. So for me, I do think possibly seamers will play a bigger role this time around, but spinners always play a role."" Panesar told TimesofIndia.com.

Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul hit the first century of the season on Thursday to lead his side to a big win over Royal Challengers Bangalore. But Panesar isn't surprised to see some big scores early in the season and the cricket-starved fans won't be complaining.
""We all know how once you start getting used to the nature of the wickets, you suddenly see big sixes and fours and the big totals. I think from the entertainment point of view, a lot of fans around the world would rather see a six than a wicket,"" Panesar said.

All the time I've known him, he was a livewire. I'm 58, he was 59, and I've known him since 1986 - that's almost 35 years.

TOI had first reported about Harley’s plans to scale down India business in its edition dated August 6 this year, while also reporting about partnership plans with Hero Moto in the February 19 and September 8 editions.
Open to partnering Harley: Pawan Munjal

Harley is not the only company to have exited India. Other on the list include General Motors and MAN Trucks, while Ford has also quit solo operations and has joined hands with Mahindra & Mahindra.
""Harley-Davidson plans to close its manufacturing facility in Bawal and significantly reduce the size of its sales office in Gurgaon. The company is communicating with its customers in India and will keep them updated on future support,"" the company said in a statement. ""The Harley-Davidson dealer network will continue to serve customers through the contract term.""
Harley’s exit comes at a time when the Indian economy and the auto industry are passing through one of their toughest periods ever as coronavirus-induced slowdown and poor consumer demand have depressed sales to historic lows. Also, companies have complained of high duty and tax structure on the automobile industry, and those voicing concern include Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota, Hero Moto, Bajaj Auto, and TVS.
Even President Trump has often raked up the issue of ""high"" import duty that Harley bikes faced in India (he called it ""unfair""), even taking it up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump’s complaints had led the Centre to reduce the duty on Harley motorcycles from 100% to 50%, though the US government still remained unsatisfied.
Harley’s exit from manufacturing in India may be a dampener for India’s trade discussions with the US, as the latter may continue to blame the import duty structure.
Harley’s problems, however, were more than just adverse duty structure. In a price-sensitive market, the company failed to bring affordable models (its lowest powered on sale in India is the Street 750cc, priced at Rs 4.7 lakh ex-showroom) in line with the demand of the broader market, despite doing local assembly at Bawal. Its India product portfolio was a mix of locally assembled models (through imported kits), apart from imported bikes.
While Harley did manage to create an aura around cruisers and leisure riding, especially through its famed HOG programme (where it had 6,500 members), the move ended up helping local brand Royal Enfield more that saw a massive growth in demand. Led by promoter Siddhartha Lal, Enfield — often seen as ""India’s Harley"" by the middle class — has been on a roll over the past few years and plans to become the world’s biggest mid-engine motorcycle maker across the world.

Harley has also been slow in striking a partnership with local players, even though other companies managed to do so. German BMW has partnered TVS Motors for lower-powered bikes, while UK’s Triumph has joined hands with Bajaj Auto.

192,"The present structure of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai might have been reconstructed during the rule of Jatavarman Kulasekara Pandya -- 1190-1216 Common Era.
This structure was damaged due to unknown reasons, and was again renovated in the 13th century during the period of Maravarman Sundarapandyan II, according to inscriptions found at the temple, said archaeological expert C. Santhalingam, here on Friday.
Mr. Santhalingam led a team of experts comprising M. Marudhu Pandiyan, Curator of Government Museum, Madurai; R. Udhayakumar, a researcher at Pandya Nadu Centre for Historical Research and B. Asaithambi, Archaeological Officer of the State Archaeology Department, to document and study the inscriptions at Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple. The findings of the inscriptions have been compiled to publish a book.
Addressing media persons to elaborate on the findings, Mr. Santhalingam said that the temple might have been a simple structure, prior to the reconstruction during the Jatavarman Kulasekara Pandya period. The temple has been renovated many times and extended with mandapams and halls during the Nayak rule, he said.
Another important finding is that in all the 13th century inscriptions belonging to Pandya period, the name of the presiding god is ‘Thiru Alavay Udaiya Nayanar’ and the goddess, ‘Thirukkamakkottam Udaiya Aludaiya Nacchiyar’. “It was during the Nayak period when the name ‘Chokkanatha’ for the presiding god was mentioned for the first time. The name of the goddess as ‘Meenakshi’ was mentioned on the engravings of a ‘pavaivilaku’ dated to 1752 CE. The present name of the goddess- ‘Meenakshi Sundareswarar’ was first mentioned on the engravings on a Tiruvachi lamp stand, dated to 1898 CE,” said Mr. Santhalingam.
A total of 410 inscriptions found at the temple were copied and published as part of this survey. Among them, only 79 inscriptions were in a readable format. As many as 301 inscriptions were fragmented and dislocated during the renovations of the temple.
Out of the 79 inscriptions, 78 were in Tamil and one inscription was in Sanskrit with grantha characters. Among these inscriptions, the earliest one belongs to the Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman period (700 CE). Inscriptions of Pandya rulers like Maravarman Sundara Pandya I and II, Jatavarman Sundara Pandya and Madurai Nayak rulers like Thirumalai Nayak and Vijayaranga Chokkanatha Nayak, were also found in the temple. These inscriptions also mention various donations made by the rulers.
One interesting inscription belonging to the Vijayaranga Chokkanatha Nayak period mentions a dispute between the palanquin bearers of the temple and government officials over the ownership of four villages, said Mr. Santhalingam. “There was an agitation in front of the east gate of the temple and a person died by jumping from the gopuram,” he added."

194,"Climbing trees, plucking mangoes, going to each other’s house in their native village Konetampettai - these are some of the memories that remain afresh in the mind of P. Subramani alias Chittamutti - the childhood friend of S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, fondly called as Mani in his village.
SPB no more: Film industry, leaders pay tribute
“We went around the village together. Mani’s mother Shakuntala known as Chinnama used to call me Chittamutti and the entire village knows me by that name now. He was loved by everyone in the hamlet. He bore my daughter’s medical expenses,” recalls Mr. Subramani who still lives in Konetampettai located in Tiruvallur district.
After news about the singer’s death came out in the media, he has been inconsolable. It is not just him; a pall of gloom has descended upon the Konetampettai village, his mother Shakuntala’s native village. “We met him when he came to our village a few years ago,” says Jayamma, Mr. Subramani’s daughter-in-law.
The entire village recalls him as humble, friendly and as a person who never forgot his roots. “He used to periodically ask about every detail about the Konetampettai hamlet. Our families are very close,” says Rajendra Prasad, his family friend.
He recalls that whenever villagers went to invite him to the hamlet for a function, he would ask what he could do for the village. “His last visit was in August 2018 and he helped build toilets for the school and a RO Plant. He was a very punctual person. Now the entire village is sad to have lost him. Many have been crying since Thursday night when news that he was critical reached us,” he explains.
A. Bhanumurthy, Mr. Subrahmanyam’s cousin, said that they were like Arjuna and Krishna. “The last time I spoke to him was on September 12. I asked him when he was getting discharged and he said he was feeling better,” he recalls. He says that his cousin could never hurt anybody, even if it was an enemy. “He will mingle with everyone right from the Prime Minister to an ordinary man,” he says.
An ardent lover of cricket, tennis and reading, SPB was a keen observer too. “He was an authority in Telugu pronunciation. He could sing in any language. He always showed the keenness and the dedication of a student even till recently. He wanted to rebuild his house in the village and had even approved the plan,” he adds.
His loss has left many speechless. “All the music lovers are in tears. We have lost a great person. Our village will miss him very much,” says Mr. Rajendra Prasad."
195,"Everybody dreams of a good house. If we ask what a good house is, everybody may have his/her own definition. Anyway, one of the simplest and direct answers can be “the good house is where we feel good”.
There will be no unanimous agreement on how to design well, with each owner, designer and builder proposing his/her own subjective ideas. Yet the basics of ‘good’ can be related to the house plan, architectural elements, building materials, construction systems and experiences.
Most people tend to ignore plan making, quickly drawing up some rooms assembled into a rectangle or start with a rectangle, dividing it into rooms. Either of the approach would end up as a piecemeal solution, not a peaceful house. Plan with all enclosed rooms, in a metaphorical way, also closes our minds, while the open plan house lets us to open our minds! So, every room should get maximum external walls, two or three preferably, to get light and air from different directions.
If the outline of the plan is not a rectangle, but with rooms staggered in and out, both the above objectives can be achieved. It also creates outdoor gardens which can be directly connected to the indoors, letting nature enter the house. All these, air, light, space, greens and outside view automatically create a feel good factor.

A major paradox about the house plan is that it can be fully seen in the drawing sheet alone, with only the rooms and spaces that we walk into being visible once the house is built. If so, how to arrive at a ‘feel good’ house, looking only at the drafted plan? Experience in planning, of course, is a pre-requisite to achieve it, besides clarity of mind in what we seek in a house.
People capable of design thinking can easily incorporate theories of plan making, specific to the type of project. Multiple theories of design exist, but what need to be applied is left to the designer and the owner. How we get to view the house would be the first criteria, which is far more important than mere elevation that all talk about. As we near the house, sense of entry becomes crucial.
As we enter the house, how the interior spaces open up comes next, with visual privacy being a determinant there. Spaces and privacy are closely interlinked. As we walk in, the source of light and air with their directions and intensity play a subtle role. Suddenly, the house may open into a garden outside or to a double height courtyard in front. Such a spatiality can be an outcome of the plan configuration – the way rooms are arranged which could be in linear fashion, diagonal angle, curvilinear profile or with sequential privacy.
Depth of the visual spaces and not necessarily the size of the rooms decides how big the house appears. Also, small and compact rooms are not welcoming as we enter. However, we can place small and bigger spaces in a sequence, which the mind finds very attractive.
The idea of room size is a misnomer, where most designers simply make the room larger hoping to get that elusive feel of largeness. In every room, there will be a functional space like just around the dining table; a measurable space which as an example, could be the size of dining room; a visual space covering all that can be seen sitting around the table, say into living room, kitchen, garden or even out of the window; and lastly the experiential space. Planning only for the functional or even measurable spaces does not help much in creating the ideal dining area.
Experiencing the house is an intangible activity of the mind and an equally intangible expression of the house itself, where plan making plays the deepest role. The unskilled designer or the uninitiated owner tends to think that using modern materials or a fascinating structural form creates the goodness. They may contribute to it partially, but the core quality comes from the plan. Our mind has an uncanny capacity to perceive spaces which leads to comfortable or uncomfortable feelings, which is the starting point of experiencing the spaces.
Piece of paper gets connected to peace of mind with the house plan drawn there and built accordingly. So next time, let us plan not only for a good house, but for a ‘feel good’ house.

197,"The present structure of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple in Madurai might have been reconstructed during the rule of Jatavarman Kulasekara Pandya (1190-1216 common era). This structure was damaged due to unknown reasons and was again renovated in the 13th century during the period of Maravarman Sundarapandyan II, according to the inscriptions found at the temple, said archaeological expert C. Santhalingam, here on Friday.
Mr. Santhalingam led a team of experts comprising M. Marudhu Pandiyan, Curator of Government Museum, Madurai; R. Udhayakumar, a researcher at Pandya Nadu Centre for Historical Research; and B. Asaithambi, Archaeological Officer of The State Archaeology Department, to document and study the inscriptions at Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple. The findings of the inscriptions have been compiled to publish a book.
Addressing mediapersons to elaborate on the findings, Mr. Santhalingam said that the temple might have been a simple structure, prior to the reconstruction during the Jatavarman Kulasekara Pandya period. The temple has been renovated many times and extended with mandapams and halls during the Nayak rule, he said.
Another important finding is that in all the 13th century inscriptions belonging to Pandya period, the name of the presiding god is mentioned as ‘Thiru Alavay Udaiya Nayanar’ and goddess was mentioned as ‘Thirukkamakkottam Udaiya Aludaiya Nacchiyar’. “It was during the Nayak period when the name ‘Chokkanatha’ for the presiding god was mentioned for the first time. The name of the goddess as ‘Meenakshi’ was mentioned on the engravings of a ‘pavaivilaku’ dated to 1752 CE. The present name of the goddess- ‘Meenakshi Sundareswarar’ was first mentioned on the engravings on a Tiruvachi lamp stand dated to 1898 CE,” said Mr. Santhalingam.
A total of 410 inscriptions found at the temple were copied and published as part of this survey. Among them only 79 inscriptions were in a readable format. As many as 301 inscriptions were fragmented and dislocated during the renovations of the temple.
Out of the 79 inscriptions, 78 were in Tamil language and one inscription was in Sanskrit language with grantha characters. Among these inscriptions, the earliest one belongs to the Arikesari Parankusa Maravarman period (700 CE). Inscriptions of Pandya rulers like Maravarman Sundara Pandya I and II, Jatavarman Sundara Pandya and Madurai Nayak rulers like Thirumalai Nayak and Vijayaranga Chokkanatha Nayak, were also found in the temple. These inscriptions also mention various donations made by the rulers.
One interesting inscription belonging to Vijayaranga Chokkanatha Nayak period mentions about a dispute between the palanquin bearers of the temple and government officials over the ownership of four villages, said Mr. Santhalingam. “There was an agitation in front of the east gate of the temple and a person died by jumping from the gopuram,” he added."
198,"The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on Friday said the Gujarat government’s claim that there was no chemical contamination of drinking water anywhere in the state was “not correct”.
In its report tabled in the state Assembly, the CAG cited laboratory reports and mentioned that over 20,000 out of 1.30 lakh samples, that is 15%, “failed the chemical examination conducted by government laboratories in 2015-16”.
The report further stated that a similar trend of contamination was found in tests conducted in subsequent years.
The CAG’s performance audit report on ‘Rural drinking water supply programme in Gujarat’ for the financial year 2017-18 was tabled on Friday, the last day of the state Assemblys Monsoon session.
The CAG noted that presence of certain chemicals in drinking water above prescribed limit causes major diseases.
Arsenic causes cancer, fluoride causes fluorosis, nitrate hampers the blood’s capacity to transport oxygen resulting in brain damage, iron causes hemochromatosis.
The CAG further said the Gujarat government in March 2016 told the Centre that “the state was not water quality affected“.
However, citing government lab reports, the CAG noted that “out of 6.29 lakh water samples tested in the state during 2013-18, around 1.15 lakh samples, that is 18.30%, were found chemically unfit, having excess content of fluoride, nitrate and TDS”.
Overall contamination with regard to nitrate and fluoride as per samples tested during 2013-18 in the state was 11.89% and 4.33% respectively, the report said.
According to the report, Chhotaudepur, Dahod, Banaskantha, Panchmahal and Vadodara had high contamination of nitrate.
While worst affected by fluoride contamination were Dahod, Chhotaudepur, Banaskantha and Kheda, it was stated.
As per the audit, 54 samples were found unfit from 188 samples collected during joint physical verification.
Though the water was contaminated, people were found using it for “drinking and cooking purposes from these sources, as these habitations had no alternate source”, the CAG noted.
In a clear rebuttal, the CAG said the state government’s claim that “not a single habitation was quality affected was not correct”, the report said."
199,"Teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg is back. She joined fellow demonstrators outside the Swedish Parliament on Friday to kick off a day of socially distanced global climate protests.
The main hope is, as always, to try to have an impact on the level of awareness and public opinion so that people will start becoming more aware, the 17-year-old told reporters.
The coronavirus outbreak has prevented the Fridays for Future movement that Thunberg inspired from holding its mass rallies in recent months, lowering its public profile.
Ms. Thunberg started her solo protests outside Sweden’s parliament in Stockholm on Aug. 20, 2018. Students around the world soon began following her lead, staging regular large protests, and she was invited to speak to political and business leaders at U.N. conferences and the annual World Economic Forum in Davos.
Ms. Thunberg’s blunt words to Presidents and Prime Ministers, peppered with scientific facts about the need to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions, have won her praise and awards, but also the occasional criticism and even death threats.
They demand that lawmakers stick to the 2015 landmark Paris climate deal that asks both rich and poor countries to take action to curb the rise in global temperatures that is melting glaciers, raising sea levels and shifting rainfall patterns.
It requires governments to present national plans to reduce emissions in order to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Climate protests are also planned elsewhere on Friday."
200,"S.P. Balasubrahmanyam leaves behind a huge body of work in Kannada, including an entire generation of singers who consider him mentor and inspiration.
The very second song SPB sang for a film, just a week after his debut in Telugu, was in Kannada in December 1966 and he went on to have glorious innings as a playback singer in the Kannada industry till his death.
From the mid-1970s, SPB’s voice dominated the Kannada screen for nearly three decades, singing playback for almost all leading men of the times. His voice became synonymous with that of Srinath, Vishnuvardhan, Ambareesh, Anant Nag, Shankar Nag, Ravichandran to Shivarajkumar and Ramesh Aravind. There are actors whose entire discography is probably sung by SPB alone. Vishnuvardhan was one such, as the actor was insistent on it, industry insiders say.
“The unique quality of SPB was that he never imitated but tweaked his voice to suit the actor he sang for. It always sounds as if I was singing it myself. He brought that magic to playback singing. Audience listening to songs on a radio would immediately not just identify it was SPB’s voice but also who he was singing for,” observed Srinath.
Shivarajkumar, one of the actors whose songs have been sung by SPB from his debut, said, acting for songs was always a challenge and listening to songs recorded by SPB was work half-done. “He was a great actor and he brought it out in his voice.”
His most celebrated collaborations were with music composer duo Rajan-Nagendra in the 1970s and early 1980s, followed by Hamsalekha. “I attribute the success of the music of my first hit Premaloka entirely to SPB. I wanted to try new voices for that album, but failed. Then I opted for SPB, which I was not happy about in the beginning. But once he sang those songs, I realised what he brought to the table and I had a long collaboration with him,” Hamsalekha recalled.
SPB won a national award for a Tansen song in “Sangeeta Sagara Ganayogi Panchakshara Gavai” in 1995, for which music was composed by Hamsalekha. “He was hesitant to sing songs in the film as they were based on classical ragas. But given that both of us were not trained in classical music, we experimented and that fetched a national award,” recalled Hamsalekha.
The music reality show “Ede Tumbi Haaduvenu” he hosted on ETV Kannada from 2003 to 2012 took him to every home and increased the intimacy of the relationship he had with Kannadigas. Writer and lyricist Jayant Kaikini, who was a judge on the show for over three years, recalls the way he encouraged participants, especially children. “When a child sang well, he used to often say they were singing far better than he had sung in the film, without any ego,” he observed.
What also earned SPB a special place in the hearts of Kannada audience was that he learnt Kannada, spoke fluently and was keen on the pronunciation of every letter in a song. He was even critical of the industry bringing “outsiders who did not focus on language” to sing for Kannada films. Kannada always held a special place for SPB and he always reminded people that the affection was mutual and even said Kannadigas perhaps loved him more than the audience in any language including his native tongue Telugu.
He was presented the Karnataka Rajyotsava award in 2008 and had won four State film awards for best playback singer (male) apart from a national award for a Kannada film."
201,"The Anamalai police in rural Coimbatore on Friday arrested a youth on charges of sexually assaulting a minor girl and impregnating her. The accused was identified as a resident of a village near Anamalai.
The police said that the accused and the survivor, a 17-year-old girl, lived in the same locality. The girl’s brother and the accused were friends and the latter became close to her, said the police.
According to the police, the accused, a daily wage labourer, used to frequent the girl’s house when she was alone. The youth sexually assaulted the girl eight months ago, and she became pregnant, said the police.
The girl was recently taken to a nearby Government hospital where doctors found that she was seven months pregnant. She was admitted to the Government Headquarters, Hospital, Pollachi.
The accused was arrested under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act based on a complaint lodged by the parents of the girl."
202,"Members of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha staged a protest by blocking traffic on some State highways and district main roads in Belagavi district on Friday. The roads included Jatt-Jamboti State highway in Khanapur and some places in Yamakanamaradi and rural Belagavi.
They raised slogans against the Union government for amendments to the APMC Act, Essential Commodities Act and the new contract farming rules. They also raised slogans against the State government alleging that its amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act removed land ceilings and allowed corporate companies to buy land.
Leaders said that they would continue to agitate till the amendments were withdrawn. KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi said that the Congress expressed its support to the protest by farmers. However, the Congress would organise a separate set of protests about these vital laws across the country and the State.
In Vijayapura, police stopped the weekly farmers’ market on Solapur road following the announcement by farmers’ organisations that they would block the Solapur-Vijayapura road in protest against the farm bills. The police did not allow farmers to block the highway. They submitted a memorandum to the government and dispersed."

204,"The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), General Insurance Corporation of India and The New India Assurance Co have been identified as Domestic Systemically Important Insurers (D-SIIs) for 2020-21 by insurance regulator IRDAI.
Given the nature of operations and their systemic importance, the three public sector insurers have been asked to raise the level of corporate governance as well as identify all relevant risk and promote a sound risk management culture.
The D-SIIs will also be subjected to enhanced regulatory supervision, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said.
According to the regulator, D-SIIs refer to insurers of such size, market importance and domestic and global inter connectedness whose distress or failure would cause a significant dislocation in the domestic financial system. Thus, the continued functioning of D-SIIs is critical for the uninterrupted availability of insurance services to the national economy.
D-SIIs are perceived as insurers that are ‘too big or too important to fail’. This perception and the perceived expectation of government support may amplify risk taking, reduce market discipline, create competitive distortions, and increase the possibility of distress in future. These considerations require that D-SIIs should be subjected to additional regulatory measures to deal with the systemic risks and moral hazard issues, IRDAI said.
The regulator said it has developed a methodology for identification and supervision of D-SIIs. The parameters include the size of operations in terms of total revenue, including premium underwritten and the value of assets under management; and global activities across more than one jurisdiction. The Authority said it would identify D-SIIs on an annual basis and disclose the names of such insurers for public information.
In January 2019, while announcing the formation of a committee on D-SIIs, the regulator had said the insurance sector had grown exponentially in the last 15 years and a few of the insurers have a sizeable market share and interconnected with other financial institutions as well. The failure of D-SIIs has the potential to cause significant disruption to the essential services they provide to the policyholders and, in turn, to the overall economic activity of the country, it had said.
The constitution of the committee came in the backdrop of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) asking all member countries to have a regulatory framework to deal with Domestic-SIIs."
205,"Goa leads India in the per capita production of plastic waste in India at 61.2 gm per day, followed by Delhi and Chandigarh, said a report on the state of plastic waste by the Centre for Science and Environment released in Delhi on Thursday. Just seven States — Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh — generate two thirds of the country’s plastic waste.
India’s national per capita plastic waste generation is 7.6 gm per day and the country, it is estimated, produces 3.3 trillion grams of plastic waste per year. These figures were based on numbers and estimates by the Central Pollution Control Board.
Plastic waste comprises around 6% of India’s solid waste generation of 55-65 million tonnes.
Almost 66% of plastic waste comprised of mixed waste — polybags, multilayer pouches used for packing food items sourced mainly from households and residential localities. These, according to the study, were plastic waste which could not be recycled.
A global material balance study on plastics points out that 79% of the total plastics produced in the world enters our environment as waste. Only 9% of the total plastic waste in the world is recycled.
“We had imagined that we had solved the problem of plastic waste through recycling it, or burying it, or shipping it out of our sight. But we were wrong. Plastic waste is everywhere today. It is in our faces. It is filling up our oceans and destroying marine life and even invading our food chain to get into our bodies. Our per capita use of plastics is growing — and as we become richer, we will end up generating more plastic waste,” Sunita Narain, CSE Director-General, said at a webinar at the release of the report.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India plans to eliminate the use of single use plastic and the government first committed to eliminating it by 2022 but then backtracked on the grounds that it would be too “disruptive” to the economy, the CSE report added."
206,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) raided multiple locations associated with trade across the Line of Control (LoC) on Thursday.

“These persons have been associated with the cross-LoC trade,” an official said.
Sources said the traders were questioned and also trade-related documents were sought during these raids.
The NIA is investigating links between the traders and militancy in J&K. Around 30 traders and separatists are under the NIA scanner, including Tanveer Bardhan, who served as president of a trade union.
The cross-LoC trade was suspended in 2019 after the Ministry of Home Affairs disclosed the link between traders and the separatists in Kashmir."
207,"The Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) clarified in the Supreme Court on Thursday that their refund and credit shell policy for flights cancelled during the lockdown did not cover international flights originating from abroad.
“The regulatory mechanism does not cover international flights which originate from any foreign destination... These flights are governed by the regulatory mechanism of the country of origin, irrespective of the fact whether the carrier is Indian or not... Refund of tickets/credit shells of international flights would be governed by the law of the sovereign country from where such flights originate,” the affidavit filed jointly for DGCA and the Ministry said.
The Ministry was replying to questions raised by the airlines and the petitioner, Pravasi Legal Cell, represented by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Jose Abraham. The case is scheduled to be heard on September 25.
The affidavit clarified that neither the DGCA nor the Ministry have any role in the private arrangements made between travel agents and airlines for lump sum booking of air tickets in advance. These arrangements were made with an eye on private commercial gain. Regulators like DGCA had no role in such arrangements. The contract of purchase of such tickets did not come under the Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs).
“This lump-sum payment of money by a travel agent or a corporate house on behalf of his client to the airlines, either in advance or after availing the flight services, is not recognised as a contract of purchase of tickets under the CARs. They remain in the realm of private contract between the parties. The CARs recognizes only those tickets, which are actually issued by the airline in the name of a known and identified traveller, who is either the client of the travel agent or an employee of a corporate house,” the affidavit clarified.
Travel agents and tour operators had raised concerns over how they would be refunded for tickets they had booked in advance and in bulk for flights which were cancelled during the lockdown. The refund and credit shell proposal of the government only recommends payment of refund and opening of credit shells in the names of the passengers."
208,"The Builders’ Association of India (BAI) has requested the Tamil Nadu government to reduce the stamp duty and registration charges to a maximum 4%, similar to States like Maharashtra and Karnataka. The construction industry has been hit due to the pandemic, the BAI said.
BAI southern centre chairman L. Shantha Kumar said stamp duty in Tamil Nadu was the highest when compared to other States and it was a huge burden on the buyers who had to pay 11% stamp duty and registration charges. “All other States have cut down on stamp duty charges,” he said.
Recently, the governments of Maharashtra and Karnataka reduced stamp duty and registration charges from 5% to 3% to boost their realty sector.
The association also sought clearance of several bills due to contracts pending with various government departments.
The BAI further sought the revision of water tax and sewerage charges, as per the rates in force prior to financial year 2018-19.
“The water and sewerage taxes, that are being calculated according to annual rental value assessed by the Corporation of Chennai were not revised to earlier rates even after the government rolled back the hike in property tax in Chennai,” Mr. Kumar said. “The CMWSSB is not complying with the above orders and is still collecting water tax and sewerage charges in enhanced rates, ignoring the government orders,” he charged.
The BAI favoures an online single-window system for local, DTCP and CMDA approvals similar to Telangana, which has adopted the “Telangana State Building Permission Approval and Self Certification System (TS-bPASS)”, that provides building permission approvals within 21 days without any hassles. If the builder does not get a permission within 21 days, an automatic approval will be generated on the following day, reducing the time to get permission approvals."
209,"Senior Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh on Thursday termed the twin farm bills passed by Parliament as surgical strikes on farmers.
The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 passed by both Houses would help multinational companies access Indian rural agri-market, said Mr. Singh, addressing a press conference here.
Amendments in labour laws were an assault on labourers while twin bills on farming were surgical strikes on peasants, he said.
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi often accuses Congress of lying on minimum support price. Our demand is that his government should include MSP provisions in the law and make it illegal if a trader purchases farm produce below MSP. The intention of the government is to give billionaires entry into rural agri-market. So far the Indian agri-market has been controlled through government interventions,” said the veteran Congress leader.
“The farm bills allow the Centre to control of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) and small farmers will have to go to New Delhi for dispute resolution if dispute is not resolved at district level. Farmers cannot go to civil court,” he pointed out.
Stating that contract farming provisions were against interests of farmers, Mr. Singh pointed out, “now, multinational companies can enter into contract with any farmers’ group. Farmers cannot sell their produce above the price mentioned in the contract.”
“The Narendra Modi Government has come up with a contract farming which is similar to East India Company’s contracts against which Mahatma Gandhi had started campaign from Champaran. The multinational companies will ask farmers to sign exhaustive agreements which hardly any farmer could understand,” said Mr. Singh.
Stating that the Narendra Modi government was under tremendous pressure from the WTO which advocates free trade, the Congress leader said, “Congress has been resisting this pressure. In 1993, the Congress government had clearly said India would never compromise with interest of small farmers and poor. We had told that our poor population was fighting against malnutrition and WTO cannot put pressure on us.”
“Till 2013, the Indian government had not compromised on how much grain can be stocked up on this despite tremendous pressure. In 2015, BJP-led government compromised on this and gave permission on import of wheat and rice,” said Mr Singh.
“When wheat and rice start coming from foreign, prices will drop. It will harm farmers,” he said."
210,"In line with the Trump administration’s progressive restrictions on visas, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed a rule on Thursday limiting the duration of initial admission for foreign media (I visas), students (F visas) and exchange visitors (J visas).
The rule proposes fixed time periods and extension periods for the three visa categories which currently operate under the “duration of status” framework.

Currently, visa holders in these categories are allowed to remain in the US for as long as the conditions of admission are met (for example, as long as an F visa holder is enrolled in a university and meeting other conditions). This rule, if finalised, will change that.
Under the new proposed rule F and J students would be admitted for an initial period of four years only (the normal duration of an American undergraduate degree). However, the duration of stay will be two years for those from countries with visa-overstay rates greater than 10% and those non-US citizens either born in or holding citizenship of a country on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. F and J students already admitted will have their “duration of status” terms converted to a term ending with the end of their program (not to exceed four years) if and when the proposed DHS rule becomes final.

“The significant growth of the F, J and I visa programs has necessitated this proposed update to ensure the integrity of the U.S. immigration system, but this rule does not propose changes to the underlying requirements to qualify for these nonimmigrant classifications,” a DHS press statement said.
Foreign Journalists to be admitted for 240 days initially
Foreign media visa holders will initially be admitted for a period not exceeding 240 days with “an opportunity to extend their stay for a maximum of 240 days based on the length of relevant activities,” the statement said."
211,"Sivaganga district has successfully cured 95.1% of the patients who had tested positive to COVID-19, said Deputy Director of Health Yasodamani here on Thursday.
Between April and August, 4,576 pregnant women were screened and 298 among them tested positive. They were all treated for the infection and the babies were delivered safely. During the pandemic, 4,810 deliveries were performed in the district, Dr. Yasodamani told The Hindu.
For the benefit of senior citizens who could not move out of home due to the pandemic, government doctors were available on mobile phone 93454 67903 for consultation, she said and added that downloading the eSanjeevani App had been beneficial to the needy. About 1,600 patients had used the the App so far, she said.
Another official said that so far 77,133 people were screened in the district and 4,878 among them tested positive, which was 6.3 % of the total tests.
Collector J Jayakanthan said that among the 10 districts in south Tamil Nadu, Sivaganga had been maintaining the 10th position till date with 297 active cases in hospitals till Wednesday.
With swift test results made possible in the district's three testing machines, they had increased the testing from 700 to 1,500 persons in a day, Dr. Yasodamani said and added that in July, 19,605 people were tested and 1,830 of them were found positive. In August, 21,192 tests were taken and 1,035 tested positive and in September, 22,303 tests were taken and 479 turned out to be positive.
Hence, the infection was on the decline. However, people must continue to take caution and stay indoors and use facemasks properly while going out. Using hand sanitisers and maintaining physical distancing would prevent COVID-19 from spreading, she said."
212,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday allowed Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officer Bhagyavant Late to file their replies to a plea filed by actor Kangana Ranaut after the civic body demolished her bungalow in Bandra.
Advocate Pradeep Thorat representing Mr. Raut and senior advocate Anil Sakhare appearing for Mr. Late sought time before a Division Bench of Justice S.J. Kathawalla and Justice R.I. Chagla to file their replies.
Mr. Thorat said that he needed time to file an affidavit as Mr. Raut being an MP was in Delhi.
The Bench, however, made a remark on the BMC seeking time to reply, and said, “You need more time here but otherwise you are very fast (in demolishing).”
While allowing them time, the court said, “Since 40% of the petitioner’s (Ms. Ranaut) bungalow was already demolished on September 9 and the bungalow continues to stand in a partially demolished condition, it is likely that some mishap may be caused due to heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest.”
The Bench thus directed senior advocate Birendra Saraf representing the actor to commence his arguments on September 25 at 3p.m..
On September 9, the BMC undertook a drive to demolish alleged illegal portions of Ms. Ranaut’s office. Soon thereafter, the court had directed the BMC to stay the process of demolition.
A stop work notice pertaining to substantial alterations and additions carried out unlawfully was issued by the BMC under Section 354A (power of designated officer to stop erection of building or work commenced or carried on unlawfully) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act to Ms. Ranaut on September 8."

The Bill was considered necessary for amending the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947, the Factories Act, 1948, Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, (all Central acts) in their application to Karnataka.
Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar introduced the Bill, replacing the Ordinance, aimed at promoting ease of doing business in the State."
214,"The Karnataka Land Revenue (Amendment) Bill, 2020, for regularisation of unauthorised use of ‘B’ kharab land in Bengaluru and outskirts of the city, was tabled in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday.
Revenue Minister R. Ashok tabled the Bill in the House which aims to amend Section 68 of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act of 1964. The amendment is to reduce the stipulated time from 90 days to one month for calling objections from the public before extinguishment of public right after making declaration on public road, street, passage or land classified as ‘B’ kharab land.
The Bill aims at disposal of pending applications for regularisation of unauthorised cultivation land — 10,572 applications in form 50 and 1,40,781 applications in form 53. The Bill extends the time limit from April 27, 2020, to another two years.
Contingency fund
The Karnataka Contingency Fund (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was passed in the Lower House for increasing the amount to be paid out of the consolidated fund of the State to the Karnataka Contingency Fund.
The Bill aims at increasing the Contingency Fund from ₹80 crore to ₹500 crore. The amount was used during the pandemic for providing financial support for various sections of the unorganised sector.
Similarly, the Karnataka Appropriation Bill, 2020, was also adopted."
215,"Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy told the Legislative Assembly on Thursday that the government was ready to provide one more opportunity for eligible autorickshaw and taxi drivers to apply for the one-time payment under the COVID relief package.
The Minister made this statement during the discussion on supplementary estimates when Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah expressed concern that a large number of drivers were yet to apply for getting the relief as the government had imposed a condition that they should possess driving badge.
He urged the government to be flexible. The Minister said the government had received applications from 2,45,844 drivers so far for relief.
Taking exception to this, Mr. Siddaramaiah pointed out that the government had estimated that 7.5 lakh drivers would be benefited by the package."
216,"The Maharashtra Congress on Thursday asked whether the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had now been renamed as the NaMo Controlled Bureau as it was neglecting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) angle in its investigations into the Bollywood-drug connection.
The Congress also wanted to know to why the NCB was avoiding a probe against actor Kangana Ranaut on her video in which she has reprortedly confessed to consuming drugs. “While the NCB made such a huge ado over a 59 gram cannabis case, at the same time, BJP activist Chandrakant Chauhan was arrested in Karnataka with 1,200 kg of cannabis and the NCB didn’t even bother to look into the case,” State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said.
He said actor Ragini Dwivedi, a star campaigner of Karnataka BJP, was arrested in a drug case. “Aditya Alva too has been arrested. Mr. Alva is the brother-in-law of Gujarat BJP’s star campaigner, actor Vivek Oberoi, and Mr. Oberoi is the co-producer of the Modi biopic with Sandeep Ssingh. Mr. Oberoi is a partner in Mr. Singh’s production company,” Mr. Sawant said.
The Congress leader pointed out that the alleged BJP-Bollywood-sandalwood-Goa drug connection was not being probed.
Mr. Sawant said that the poster release of the Modi biopic was done in the presence of the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “It is yet to be revealed whom Mr. Ssingh had called 53 times in the BJP office and who had helped him in a case in Mauritius. All these things are linked. The Maharashtra government has told the CBI about this. But to this day, this angle has not been investigated which is surprising,” Mr. Sawant said.
“Even Ms. Ranaut is missing from the NCB’s drug connection probe. She has confessed that she was taking drugs. While her video is evidence of drug use, why isn’t she being questioned?” asked Mr. Sawant, pointing out that at a time when the NCB is calling people for an inquiry based on WhatsApp chats, it is turning a blind eye to Ms. Ranaut’s video."
217,"The Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR), Kozhikode, will host the 31st annual workshop of the All India Coordinated Research Project on Spices (AICRPS) from September 29. The two-day national workshop will review all major research projects related to production of spices and future research plans for enhanced spices varieties.
The virtual workshop is expected to draw the participation of scientists working on various spice crops in 14 agro climatic zones in 25 States. The latest research outcomes on 17 spice crops covering black pepper, large cardamom, small cardamom, ginger, turmeric, mango ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, coriander, cumin, fennel, fenugreek, ajwain, nigella, saffron, and kalazeera will be discussed and reviewed for future development at the workshop.
R. Chandra Babu, Vice Chancellor, Kerala Agricultural University, will open the event. It will be chaired by A.K. Singh, Deputy Director General of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR).
Vikramaditya Pandey, Assistant Director General, ICAR; Homey Cheriyan, Director, Directorate of Arecanut and Spices Development; Gopal Lal, Director, ICAR National Research Centre on Seed Spices, and Nirmal Babu, former director of IISR will address the inaugural session. Experts from 38 centres under AICRPS with 19 regular centres, 11 co-opting centres, and eight voluntary centres are also expected to attend the event.
IISR officials say AICRP being the largest spices research network under ICAR has been instrumental in developing 176 crop-wise technologies for varietal improvement, nutrient availability and plant health management in various spice crops. It also plays a crucial role in increasing farmer income by supporting various research activities in spices at 14 agro climatic zones in the country, they add."
218,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday took suo moto cognisance of the building collapse in Bhiwandi in Thane and said that it was a very serious incident where 41 people were declared dead and 25 people had been rescued by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).
A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a matter related to a construction in Kalyan Dombivali and the Chief Justice said that the incident in Bhiwandi was very serious.
The 43-year-old Jilani building in the powerloom town of Bhiwandi was around 10 km from Thane. The three-storey building had 40 flats and 150 people were living there.
The court said, “A building has collapsed in Bhiwandi; several lives have been lost. We are told the situation is quite serious in Mumbai too.”
Taking suo moto cognisance of the incident, the court made the State of Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, and the civic bodies of Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Kalyan-Dombivali, Thane, and Navi Mumbai as respondents in the case.
The court issued notices to the State and all municipal corporations, and directed Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to ensure that all parties file their replies in two weeks.
Mr. Kumbhakoni said, “We will file our replies detailing what has been done so far across the State for such buildings and measures taken, as well as the steps we propose to take in future.”
The NDRF called off its search and rescue operations on Thursday morning. Among the 41 dead are three toddlers and 18 children from the age of two to 15. The building was not in the list of dilapidated structures of the Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation."
219,"The United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the World Bank Group’s global practices have recognised sustainability as an essential issue of global importance. Economic, social and other forms of sustainability have evolved over the years, but it is environmental sustainability that has gained significant popularity.
Environmental sustainability is understood as buying greener products, avoiding hazardous materials, energy optimisation, and waste reduction. While some firms are still reluctant to engage in environmentally beneficial activities as they are afraid to compromise on the economic benefits, some others have positioned environmental practices at the forefront due to legislation, and industry and government commitments. In several firms, high importance has been given to environmentalism due to compelling regulatory norms, and a potential to manage costs, risks and optimise eco-friendly practices. However, in this process, organisations, especially in the manufacturing sector, get so serious about the low-hanging fruits of waste reduction and energy efficiency improvements that they fail to recognise the need for restructuring their learning imperatives and see the big picture of environmentalism. While government norms, organisational policies and corporate environmental responsibility projects drive environment-friendly practices, these are merely short-term actions towards environmental sustainability.

Long-lasting benefits
Only through organisational learning can people be urged to work towards long-lasting benefits. In this context, green supply chain practices are useful. These include green procurement, green manufacturing, green distribution, and reverse logistics. With practices starting from acquisition of eco-friendly raw material to disposal/ reuse/ recycle of used products,employees, suppliers, distributors, retailers and customers will be able to integrate environmental concerns in the daily operations of a firm. Thus, green supply chain practices enable organisational learning in environmental sustainability.
Our research, based on a survey of 220 respondents across 21 manufacturing units in India, points to the inter-linkages between green supply chain practices, organisational performance and learning. We found that these inter-linkages not only lead to a long-lasting natural drive towards environmental performance, but also to higher economic performance . Research shows that the positive impacts of environmentalism can only be felt in the long term when they get embedded into organisational learning systems through green supply chain practices. The resultant learning system smoothens the knowledge flow in the organisation and help firms to strategise for better performance, bearing in mind the environmental aspects. This further promotes environmentalism across all players in manufacturing supply chains. Thus, environmental sustainability is ensured from the source (willingness) and not through force (regulations).
Opinion | No, the lockdown is not a green moment
Understanding links
Drawing linkages between green supply chain practices, corporate environmental performance, corporate economic performance and the dimensions of learning organisations in firms is necessary for an organisation’s progress and environmental protection in society. Understanding these inevitable links will enable managers and experts to shape their organisational values, work practices, and performances for the greater good of society.
We infer that when the different players of a manufacturing supply chain realise the inherent benefits associated with organisational learning dimensions, their drive towards environmentalism increases. Policymakers should support this thinking by not merely imposing environmental practices as regulatory norms but by emphasising on the creation of green supply chain-based learning systems in manufacturing.

220,"Three farm bills — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill (commonly referred to as the APMC Bypass Bill), and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill — were cleared by Parliament amid protests from the Opposition. Sudha Narayanan (Associate Professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research) and Arindam Banerjee (Associate Professor at the School of Liberal Studies at Ambedkar University) discuss the implications of the controversial Bills in a conversation moderated by Vikas Dhoot. Edited excerpts:
What are the concerns about these Bills? Do they hold up?
Sudha Narayanan: Sometimes we say, ‘Be careful what you wish for, you may actually get it’. These Bills represent fairly important changes in marketing regulation and are what many were asking for because of the flaws in the APMC [Agricultural Produce Market Committee] system. But at the same time, they are worrying for two reasons. The first is in what they say. The Bills have lacunae: lack of regulation, regulatory oversight and reporting. They’re somewhat non-transparent. The second is what they do not say. You can’t have marketing Bills that are devoid of the larger context of State intervention in agriculture, and agricultural policy.

Will the farm bills give farmers a choice? | The Hindu Parley podcast
 Could you give us examples of a couple of those?
Sudha Narayanan: The APMC bypass Bill is the most controversial. This Bill actually assumes that private players don’t exist today and the APMC is a monopoly. That is a flawed assumption. Private players actually look to the APMC for a reference price to conduct their own transactions.
Now you’re trying to create an alternative that’s outside the APMC, which is on advantageous terms where you don’t have to pay mandi fees or taxes. This could result in two perverse consequences. One is that the APMC continues to set the reference price. That makes no sense because if your private players are still looking to the APMC for a reference price, then your idea of getting rid of the inefficient APMC doesn’t hold. Large-scale trade outside the mandi is bound to happen because new players will prefer to trade outside the mandi because they don’t have to pay charges. APMC traders too might now prefer to operate outside the mandi for the same reason. So, if the APMC system collapses, then this Bill hasn’t envisioned any alternative for a large market that can actually set price signals. So, instead of unifying the national market, you could actually have little bargaining islands where people are just setting prices. This might undermine farmer interests. And in that new trade area, there is no regulation, no data, transactions are invisible. In the current APMC system, even with its flaws, at least there is some recording and grievance redressal. The current Bill leaves too much to the benevolence of private players to give fair terms to the farmers.

Arindam Banerjee: Private trade in agricultural commodities is not something new in India. At the same time, the justification for these Bills at this point of time is primarily, I think, to facilitate bigger private players into the farm sector. There are several reasons for that. The government’s justification is hinged on farmers getting better prices for their produce because they are going to get greater choices. Now, the farmers, at least the big farmers, and net surplus producers don’t seem convinced. The reason is that market prices or farmers’ incomes are not simply dependent on the market structure. Farmers’ organisations are concerned that other demands are being ignored, particularly during this difficult economic situation. Market prices are sluggish because demand is sluggish. Farmers’ incomes are actually seeing a period of stagnation. The other concern for farmers has been growing input costs. Farmers have been squeezed between rising costs of cultivation and sluggish prices. These concerns need interventions from the government in the form of subsidies or procurement. There is MSP [Minimum Support Price] and procurement but one major concern is that certain policy documents were presented before the government earlier, which talked about replacing the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and PDS with cash transfers.
What might happen as a result of the facilitation of big players into the farm sector is that some farmers will get better choices and big farmers will actually start selling to the private players. There is a possibility that the importance of the APMC and the procurement system will actually wither away over time. And that concerns everybody.

There is concern that big retail players and corporates could end up monopolising farm trade and vitiate farmers’ interests. What are the global precedents and can we learn something from there?
Sudha Narayanan: Internationally, we’ve seen cartels. The French dairy producers and the dairy farmers’ co-operatives in the U.S. have become huge players. A lot of buyer cartels fix the price, and that’s one of the reasons the EU and the U.S. are taking a hard look at their own supply chains to reduce the power of consolidation.
In India, it’s going to be less predictable, because big players themselves want to minimise costs. The traditional marketing channels are very resilient… if the farmer goes to a trader, it is for multiple reasons, not just the sale of crop. The trader extends credit, has a deeper relationship of trust and he will take all kinds of quality. The farmer runs a lot of risks dealing with the big players. It’s not a given that the big players will come in, set up shop and crowd out other players. But if they manage to get a place, there are two ways in which I have seen them operate. One is to try to crowd out competition and the other is to co-opt them. Big businesses are well positioned to interact with a lot of farmers because they have the field staff. But eventually, many of them end up co-opting farmer cooperatives or anybody who’s able to aggregate produce for them. So, though we keep saying that these Bills will facilitate direct transactions with farmers, what we are seeing is not dis-intermediation, but re-intermediation. Companies will find that it’s too expensive to work with a large number of farmers and look for intermediaries who will aggregate produce for them.

Arindam Banerjee: If you look at the global experience, corporate food markets are all about monopolies or duopolies. So, we can expect that to happen. But what I’m more concerned about is this: private trade in agricultural commodities has existed for several years in India, so what is the new usefulness from the perspective of big capital? Pepsi has been in the potato value chain and there are several other examples of contract farming. I think the new thrust area is the grain trade in India and that is where procurement by the government happens. I think global corporates are eyeing the grain market. With more than 90 million tonnes of foodgrain in our stocks, it is clear that there is a massive market to play around with, only if there is a relative shift of weight from government regulation to private players. Even with the pandemic measures, the stocks have not reduced. The pandemic has caused massive disruption of jobs globally. Consequently, it has caused a massive disruption for capital and profits as well. Agricultural goods have suffered less because these are necessary items in consumption baskets. There is less chance of revival of demand of industrial goods and services to pre-pandemic levels in the near future. This is why big capital is trying to move into the agricultural commodity trade on a bigger scale, so that it can recover some of its lost profits.
Comment | It’s a no green signal from the farm world
While the Bills are said to give farmers more choices, shouldn’t they also have more predictable trade policies to work with? Every time prices rise, exports are curbed as we see with onions now.
Sudha Narayanan: What you said is important. Look at what happened after these ordinances were passed. We had the ban on export of onions. So the farmers are not getting a signal that these Bills are, in fact, farmer-centric. There’s nothing in the Bills that says what the procurement policy is going to be. In general, when you want to protect the interests of the consumers, while not undermining the interests of the farmers, you have an array of policies that work together. You can’t say, I’m not going to use the Essential Commodities Act and then try to influence consumer prices by a policy that hurts farmers.
Explainer | Why are the Agriculture Bills being opposed
The Opposition and some farmer groups want the MSP to be added to the legal framework so that they have a floor price of sorts. Is that some kind of a solution for now?
Arindam Banerjee: The FCI was formed in 1965 as a response to a significant food shortage in the country. From that point, we have made progress in food production. In the early 1990s, we were not facing food shortages. That did not mean that the problem of hunger was addressed. It continues to persist because there is mal-distribution of foodgrain. And that is happening in spite of the PDS. One has to recognise that we have a different political-economic regime than the time the FCI was set up. Post-liberalisation, private players and capital have a much greater role to play in the economy, which is fine. But then you also need regulations for those players. So, if today there is a perceived concern about the government public procurement system, then it’s a valid demand to include a clause regarding procurement, or maybe just bring in another law that would quell a lot of fears.
Also read | Why is govt. ‘running away’ from giving legal responsibility for MSP, asks Congress
Sudha Narayanan: Given that these Bills are quite problematic, I wouldn’t want an MSP clause to be introduced into them. If these Bills are flawed, we have to think of ways of fixing them. And I think the MSP question is larger, more complex, and deserves a very serious consultative process, and its own dedicated Act. Now the two may not be compatible. Because you can’t say I want to get private players but insist what price they deal with. That’s going to be self-defeating both for the MSP as well as for private participation. The reason MSP has to be a separate question is because farmers from Punjab may disagree with farmers from Bihar. So, how are you going to enforce the MSP? There have been interesting suggestions there. One suggestion was, if the APMCs were functioning as they would under the old regime, then you would ensure that all bidding starts at the MSP, which ensures that the MSP starts as a floor price. We’ve lost that opportunity now because now if you say APMC has a MSP, but outside it, you can do whatever you want, then it makes no sense any more.
If we keep an MSP that actually forces the government to procure way more than it needs (like China did a decade ago and could not distribute it within the country or export it), then unless you have a very well-planned distribution system, does it make economic sense for the government? Who is going to take responsibility, and how is it going to be geographically distributed and across crops? So, even if you were to go for an MSP legislation, there needs to be serious discussion on all these different aspects.

Is there any scope for course corrections in these Bills?
Arindam Banerjee: There cannot be minor tweaks; major corrections need to be done. The consultative process that was missing within our federal democratic structure... at least some amount of that needs to be done. I may sound like an alarmist, but on the face of it, if these Bills undermine the grain procurement system, there could be Balkanisation of the country. It’s not simply a matter of farmers anymore, it’s a much deeper concern.

221,"The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to grant 30 more days of ordinary leave to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case life convict A.G. Perarivalan, who was already granted 60 days of leave between November 5, 2019, and January 11 this year.
Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan disposed of a habeas corpus petition (HCP) filed by his mother T. Arputham and ordered relaxation of the prison rules, which do not permit a convict to avail ordinary leave within two years from the date when the previous leave had expired.
Medical complications
The orders were passed considering several medical complications suffered by Perarivalan and the fact that he was under incarceration for the past 29 years. The judges also took note that the convict had been granted 60 days of leave in 2017 also, and his conduct was found to be satisfactory.
The judges further ordered notice to the State government on a sub-application preferred by Ms. Arputham seeking a copy of the Raj Bhavan’s reply to the government on the status of a recommendation made by the Cabinet to release all seven life convicts in the case.
During the hearing of the HCP, the public prosecutor had informed the court that though the State Cabinet had made the recommendation on September 9, 2018, the Governor was awaiting the report of the Multi Disciplinary Monitoring Authority (MDMA) before taking a call on the issue.
The MDMA was constituted pursuant to the Jain Commission of Inquiry to probe into the larger conspiracy behind the assassination."
222,"The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) has cancelled the licence of the quarry at Illithodu, where two migrant workers were killed in a blast at an unauthorised storage of detonators on Monday.
The licence for possession, sale, and use, which is issued by PESO, was cancelled under the provisions of the Explosives Rules, 2008. Two migrant workers from Salem in Tamil Nadu and Chamarajanagar in Karnataka were killed in the explosion.
A preliminary report filed by the Controller of Explosives, PESO, Kochi, had said that the detonators were stored in an unauthorised building. The ‘magazine’ (building or structure intended for storage of explosives) as per the Explosives Rules approved by PESO was located 3 km away from the quarry. The explosives were found stacked in a building used to accommodate quarry workers.
Senior PESO officials pointed out that it was a common practice among quarry managements to store explosives in temporary spaces close to the sites. “Explosives are often stored in such unauthorised spaces for convenience. Those entrusted with the job may act on their own or under directions from above to keep the detonators in unauthorised buildings,” they said.
The rules make it clear that no person should receive from or transfer explosives to anyone for temporary storage or safe custody on licensed premises without prior approval from the Controller of Explosives or the licensing authority concerned. The magazine used for storage of explosives has to maintain a safety distance of 45 metres from nearby buildings. The building approved for storage should have walls built of rock, stone, or concrete conforming to the Indian Standards (IS).
The building near the quarry site had a total carpet area of around 1,200 sq.ft. It was meant to house workers and store their personal belongings. The investigating officials were not able to assess the exact quantity of explosives at the unauthorised space, as it was completely destroyed in the blast. An estimate of the quantity of explosives used can be ascertained after verification of permission given by the Director General of Mines Safety under the Mines Act, they said."

224,"The mood was sombre in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday as it had to take up obituary reference twice on the same day. While the House paid tributes to Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi in the morning, it took up obituary reference again in the evening as MLA for Basavakalyan B. Narayan Rao died.
Both the leaders succumbed to COVID-19. Just a few days ago, Rajya Sabha member Ashok Gasti died of COVID-19.
Elected representatives succumbing to COVID-19 has caused concern, and senior Congress member K.R. Ramesh Kumar appealed to Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri to direct the government to prevent large-scale weddings.
“Though there is a restriction on the number of people who can attend weddings, in reality several of them are seeing attendance of more than 500 people. Even beegara oota (feasts organised a day after wedding) is being attended by more than 500 people. This has to be curbed,” Mr. Kumar said. He pointed out that there is often compulsions on local legislators to attend such events.
He urged the government to direct the Deputy Commissioners and the Superintendents of Police to ensure that there is a thin attendance at weddings.
Meanwhile, members, cutting across party affiliations, paid rich tributes to Mr. Rao. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said Mr. Rao, who hailed from the oppressed community of Koli Samaj, had come up the ladder through hard work. He remembered how Mr. Rao had travelled all the way from Bidar to Bengaluru on a bicycle as part of a jatha.
Bandeppa Kashempur of the JD(S) recalled that it was Mr. Rao’s dream to become an MLA once to raise the issue related to problems of his community who were still unable to find a firm financial footing."
225,"A section of farmer organisation activists on Thursday staged a protest against Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) M. Rajeevan at Thamarassery, alleging that the Forest Department was cold-shouldering farmers’ concerns over the classification of buffer zones around the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary.
The DFO who had planned to visit a few project areas to convince people’s representatives of the exact boundary of the buffer zones dropped it in the course of the protest. “I withdrew from the move, as any public protest on this issue would end up in the violation of the COVID-19 protocol. If they [protesters] are not interested in discussing the issues, we are helpless,” he told reporters on Thursday.
The DFO also clarified that the proposed buffer zones would in no way affect the inhabited areas of Kattippara and Puthuppadi villages as propagated by a section of people. “If there is any concern, it should be addressed through proper channel, and the department is ready to hear the issues. Now, it is time such concerns were resolved,” he pointed out.
Meanwhile, the protesters who shouted “DFO go back” slogans alleged that the Forest Department was trying to cover up the actual impact of the new regulations. They also complained that senior department officials were disinclined to hold discussions in the presence of those who were well-informed of the new regulations."
226,"The Congress on Thursday urged the government to set up a commission under a Supreme Court judge or special investigation team under the Chief Justice of the High Court to probe what it termed a “mega corruption scandal in BDA that has shocked the State”.
Moving an adjournment motion in the Legislative Council, Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil alleged that the party had evidence in terms of bank transactions, WhatsApp chat, and telephonic conversations to show that bribe had changed hands in the ₹666.22- crore housing complex work being executed by the BDA.
“We believe the staff at the Chief Minister’s office and home office are involved in the case. So, we are demanding a high-level inquiry,” he added.
Further, Mr. Patil alleged that a former BDA Commissioner had received ₹12 crore as bribe following which, he was transferred while ₹7 crore came as bribe through RTGS transfers from Kolkata-based shell companies to an individual named Shashidhar. “The State government should initiate action against the former BDA Commissioner under the Prevention of Corruption Act,” he urged.
While Mr. Patil was making submission to move the motion, the BJP led by Ayanur Manjunath and others took objection, and urged Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty to reject the motion. Raising technical points, they said an adjournment motion cannot be moved without completing Question Hour and Zero Hour. A war of words ensued between the ruling and the Opposition benches before the Chairman intervened and allowed Mr. Patil to speak.
Eventually, the Chairman ruled that the issue would not be taken up as adjournment motion but converted as discussion under the Rule 330 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Karnataka Legislative Council."
227,"The alleged flaws in the classification of buffer zones by including huge swathes of agricultural land around the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary have triggered widespread protest among farmers in 13 villages in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts.
An indefinite stir is likely to be launched soon under a new action committee formed by farmers’ organisations under the Kozhikode-based Karshaka Raksha Samiti.
To begin with, farmers will take out a rally on September 28 seeking the withdrawal of the latest notification on buffer zones. With the objective of mobilising public support for the cause, the march will cover all the 13 affected villages. It will conclude at Adivaram on September 29. Farmers from Wayanad too will join the rally.
Meanwhile, the committee will ensure mass participation by youth in the rally and subsequent agitations. Besides, religious and political leaders will address protesters.
According to the committee, life of rural farmers will turn miserable with the “unscientific delineation” of buffer zones. In the Malabar region, it will mainly affect farmers at Chembanoda, Chakkittappara, Changaroth, Perambra, Koorachundu, Kanthalad, Puthuppadi, Kedavoor, Kattippara, Thariyod, Pozhuthana, Achooranam and Kunnathinadu villages, it claimed.
Baby Perumalil, a leader of the committee, said any expansion of the buffer zones by grabbing farmers’ land would be opposed through united protests. “If implemented, the new buffer zone regulations will send out thousands of underprivileged farmers from their own land. Many of them are already facing wild animal attacks, fall in prices of agricultural produce, and loan burdens,” he argued.
Committee leaders claimed that the conservation of the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary could be ensured by scientifically marking the existing boundary of the forest land. Instead, there is a deliberate attempt to capture farm lands and evacuate farmers, they complained.
According to them, the Revenue authorities are also working in favour of the Forest Department’s action plan. As part of suspicious attempts to convert farm land into forest land, even land tax is not being accepted from some landholders in Vilangad and Puthuppadi villages, they alleged."
228,"Students pursuing the diploma course in elementary education staged a protest on Thursday, demanding that their exams be held online.
Several students staged a sit-in at the Lady Willindgon College of Education in the morning.
They said they wanted the government to hold online exams, similar to the B.Ed and M.Ed students.
The protest was spearheaded by the Students Federation of India. S. Mirdhula, one of the protesters, said first year students and those writing their arrears would have to take the tests without a break for 14 days.
The police later took them to the Directorate of Public Instruction, where the protesters submitted a representation. They demanded that all students who had taken the tests so far be declared passed as a large portion of the lessons had not been completed. They pointed out that public transport had not been fully restored.
There were also discrepancies in the correction of answersheets, they alleged. Since there was no response, the protesters decided to continue the demonstration."
229,"The Madras High Court on Thursday came down heavily on the Directorate of Medical Education (DME) for having given away on a “platter” about 100 post-graduate medical seats, which were filled by private medical colleges under the management quota with less meritorious candidates this year.
Justice N. Anand Venkatesh expressed anguish over the “attitude” of the DME and its Selection Committee in not having taken proper steps to conduct mop up counselling for management quota seats and instead having permitted the colleges to fill them up on their own.
“This may perfectly suit the private colleges but then it is done at the cost of overlooking merit,” the judge said and pointed out that meritorious candidates had lost the chance of being accommodated in better courses because of the failure to conduct mop up counselling on time.
The observations were made while passing interim orders on a writ petition filed by M. Keethanjali, who scored 524 marks in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for PG admissions and was allotted M.D. (Microbiology) in regular counselling held in May.
No mop up counselling
She wanted to take up M.D. (Paediatrics) during the mop up counselling process but it was never conducted.
Instead the seat was given to another student, who had scored just 298 marks in NEET, on the basis of permission given by the DME to private colleges to fill up the seats.
“At some stage, this court has to ensure that similar instances do not occur in future. There must be a mechanism to ensure that the selection process takes place strictly in accordance with the Medical Council of India regulations and guidelines issued by the Supreme Court.”
“The respondents cannot be allowed to create a situation and thereafter water down the selection process, which ultimately results in less meritorious students getting the seats and private colleges profiteering from the same,” the judge said.
He sought an explanation from the DME by October 15 for not having filed a petition in the Supreme Court on its own for extension of the last date for medical admissions this year so that mop up counselling could be conducted and meritorious students could be admitted.
Petition in SC
The judge pointed out that the DME had filed such a petition in the Supreme Court only after he directed it to do so but that application ended up being dismissed. He pointed out that other States had filed such applications on time and obtained extension of time.
He also wanted the DME to explain why it had permitted private colleges to fill up seats that were declared vacant after the regular counselling to be filled up with candidates other than those who had already been allotted seats in the regular counselling process.
The judge also wanted to know all details, such as names of candidates who were allotted seats in management quota seats of private colleges after grant of such permission by the DME, their NEET scores, the branch of medicine allotted to them and the name of the institution.
He wanted the details to be submitted on October 15 for passing further orders."
230,"The wait for the restoration of Adambakkam lake continues. With the waterbody remaining neglected for nearly a decade now, residents want it restored to prevent flooding in the surrounding localities.
Residents of Adambakkam and Nanganallur complained that the waterbody was covered with vegetation. Spread over nearly 14 hectares, Adambakkam lake is one among a group of waterbodies that has surplus water draining into the Pallikaranai marshland.
It is one of the three lakes, including Perumbakkam and Vengaivasal, chosen for the eco-restoration project at a cost of ₹12 crore with funds from the Environment Management Agency of Tamil Nadu.
The Water Resources Department (WRD) planned to restore the original storage capacity, strengthen the bund and improve the lake with recreational facilities at a cost of ₹3.5 crore.
Progress stalled
However, residents noted that the work carried out, including the walkers’ path, were stopped earlier this year. There is a threat of flooding in areas such as Adambakkam, Thillai Ganga Nagar and Nanganallur during the oncoming northeast monsoon.
V. Rama Rao, chairman of Sabari Green Foundation, said the lake had already shrunk and any delay in the project could lead to further encroachments. Desilting would lead to an increase in groundwater level.
Residents of Adambakkam charged that the process of removing encroachments from the lake had been dragging for over a decade now due to inaction of the Revenue Department and the WRD.
J.S. Augustine David, president, Federation of Adambakkam Welfare Associations, recalled that a similar project chalked out in 2014 was shelved for want of funds. “Our office bearers too gave suggestions for developing lake as a recreational space. Encroachments removal continues to be a problem and we had planned to file a public interest litigation for clearing encroachments and rejuvenation of the lake. There is an urgent need to desilt, deepen and fence the water body,” he said.
However, the Water Resources Department listed out various challenges, including plugging sewage outfalls, that delayed the project. There was also a delay in getting funds.
Officials said work was in progress to provide a flood regulator. “We are waiting for revenue authorities to verify the documents of the encroached structures to proceed with eviction,” an official said."
231,"City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal on Thursday said police personnel had been successful in arresting suspects within 24 hours in 90% of the recent criminal cases.
He rewarded the personnel involved in the arrest of 15 suspects for their alleged involvement in multiple robberies. These incidents were reported on Wednesday from Tondiarpet, Basin Bridge, Red Hills and Thiruverkadu.
Talking to reporters, Mr. Aggarwal said special teams had been constituted to trace the suspects after the incidents were reported on Wednesday. “Using electronic gadgets and some smart legwork, we have nabbed the suspects within 24 hours,” he said.
Asked whether any specific deadline was fixed for investigators to solve cases and arrest suspects, Mr. Aggarwal said, “There is no specific deadline since this affects the investigation. But we make every effort to solve cases at the earliest. Sometimes, if there is a clue, we crack the case quickly. Other times, it may take a day or two. Our analysis revealed that in 90% of recent cases, we have been successful in arresting the accused within 24 hours.”
The police recently circulated the mobile phone numbers of several personnel over social media.
Mr. Aggarwal said, “The initiative is for residents to know who are on night duty and to quickly report any suspicious activity in their locality. In addition to the police control room number, 100, we are also handing out mobile numbers of the inspectors area wise. It is to reduce the delay in response time.”"
232,"The DMK, under the leadership of president M.K. Stalin, will come to power in the upcoming Assembly election in the State in 2021 and the Congress will fight the election to ensure that Mr. Stalin ascends the Chief Minister’s throne, newly-appointed AICC in-charge for Tamil Nadu Dinesh Gundu Rao said on Thursday.
“The DMK-led alliance will sweep the election in Tamil Nadu. Our leader Rahul Gandhi had expressed his desire to see Mr. Stalin as the Chief Minister even during the campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha election,” Mr. Rao said.
Mr. Rao, who was on his first visit to the city after being appointed the party in-charge for the Tamil Nadu unit, slammed the BJP for passing the three Agriculture Bills in Parliament and the AIADMK government for supporting the anti-farmer legislations. “The AIADMK should oppose these legislation. Instead, it is supporting the BJP. Today, when the State’s interests are being harmed by the BJP, which is usurping more power every day and infringing on the State’s rights, the State’s powers are being diminished. Tomorrow, everything will be under the BJP’s control if this continues.”
‘Giving to corporates’
Mr. Rao said the three Bills were among the many attempts by the BJP to give away everything to corporates in the country.
He said contrary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claims that Minimum Support Price for farmers would be ensured, MSP would in fact collapse.
“The agriculture markets will collapse. States will lose their revenue and farmers will fall into a vicious cycle of having to accept the price paid by private individuals for their produce. The Bills will only lead to more and more contract farming in the country,” Mr. Rao warned."

Panneerselvam on Thursday condoled the death of Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi. “CM Tamilnadu was shocked to hear of the sad and untimely demise of Union Minister of State for Railways @SureshAngadi_ ji. He conveys his heartfelt condolences to the grieved family members,” Mr. Palaniswami tweeted.
In his condolence message, Mr. Panneerselvam tweeted, “Saddened and shocked by the demise of Hon’ble Union Minister of State for Railways Shri.Suresh Angadi @SureshAngadi_ ji.

235,"The Tamil Nadu Idol Wing-CID seized a huge cache of ancient panchaloha and stone idols, which were stocked on the premises of a Puducherry businessman, on Thursday.
Armed with a search warrant from a court, R. Sakthivel, Superintendent of Police, Idol Wing, and 15 personnel began the search at 10 a.m. in the ancestral house of Jean Paul Rajarathinam on Roman Rolland Street, which is located opposite the Department of Art and Culture, Puducherry.
Of the total 74 idols, 60 are of antique bronze and 14 of stone, which were suspected to be stolen from temples in Tamil Nadu. They could be worth several crores of rupees.
Rajarathinam is the brother of Marie Therese Anandi Vanina, 37, a French woman of Indian origin, whose house on Frederic Ozanam Street, Colas Nagar, Puducherry, was raided in 2016 by the Idol Wing and 11 antique bronze idols, worth several crores of rupees, were seized. Her husband Prabakaran was cited as an accused in the case and she was arrested by the Idol Wing-CID in August 2019 in Chennai on the charge of illegally exporting stolen antique idols and artefacts for several years from Puducherry to France.
A senior officer of the Idol Wing told The Hindu, “Following the dismissal of a case instituted by Rajarathinam in the Madras High Court claiming ownership of these idols, we formally obtained a warrant from a jurisdictional court and seized all these idols illegally stored here. These idols are meant only for worship in Hindu temples.”
According to the police officer, Rajarathinam claimed that his grandfather Joseph De Condappa was interested in collecting antique idols of various deities, and he had acquired them from Sambasiva Sthapathi between 1956 and the 1970s.
Rajarathinam and Vanina had a running dispute over the idols. His grandfather had obtained a registration certificate from the competent authority under the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972.
“There were no relevant records to justify that they were bought legally, and had genuine ownership. One could not obtain antiquity certificates in the 1970s for idols which were bought or made between 1956 and the 1970s. The son of Sambasiva Sthapathi told us his father did not make these kind of idols,” the senior officer said.
Sources said all the recovered idols would be produced before a court in Kumbakonam. On the orders of the court, they would be restored to the temples to which they belong."
236,"Traditional cremation will not be performed at the crematorium operated by the Kozhikode Corporation on Mavoor Road until further notice.
According to corporation sources, electric cremation as well as furnaces will continue to function. They pointed out that the traditional crematorium was an old facility that broke down quite often.
The civic body has prepared a ₹2.5-crore plan to renovate the crematorium, and Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society has been given the task. The facility will now have to be closed for the work, an official release said."
237,"The police are planning to tighten the noose around illegal quarries in the district in the wake of the death of two workers in an explosion of gelatine sticks stocked in a building near a stone quarry at Ellithodu near Malayattoor on Monday.
A high-level meeting of the police department was held at the Kalady police station on Thursday to take stock of the situation. It was decided to verify the licences of all quarries functioning in the district.
Those found stocking explosives beyond the permissible limits will be strictly dealt with, and they will be slapped with criminal charges. Those guilty of violating licence conditions will be arrested,
Meanwhile, Kaliraj Mahesh Kumar, DIG, Kochi Range, and District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik visited the accident site on Thursday as part of the probe.
The police are continuing their inspection of quarries."
238,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to establish the proposed All-India Institute of Siddha in Tamil Nadu.
In his letter, a copy of which was released to the media, Mr. Palaniswami said he had directed the officials concerned to provide all details sought by the Centre. The State government had already briefed the Union Secretary concerned but a reply was awaited, it added.
Mr. Palaniswami said the land required for the institute, with good air, rail and road connectivity, had already been identified near Chennai. He requested Mr. Modi to establish the institute in Tamil Nadu, in the current financial year. “It will be apt to establish the pioneer institute in Tamil Nadu, which is where the Siddha system originated,” he said."
239,"The Greater Chennai Corporation has removed all COVID-19 containment zones in its 15 zones, although there was a spike in the number of new COVID-19 cases on Thursday.
City Health Officer Jagadeesan said the city did not have any street with more than three index cases. “So, we have not earmarked containment zones,” said Dr. Jagadeesan.
A street is barricaded in the event of three index cases and if officials are unable to trace contacts that caused the infection.
Index case percentage
At least 30% of the COVID-19 cases in the city had been index cases in the past few months.
During the initial stages of the pandemic, the civic body created containment zones covering hundreds of households and many streets.
Restrictions were not relaxed during the initial days, affecting thousands of residents.
After a few months, the area under containment zones was reduced, covering only one street.
At one point of time, there were more than 1,000 containment zones in the city. The number fell to less than 10 last week.
Rise in cases
On Thursday, the city reported no containment zones. But the number of COVID-19 cases increased by 1,089. The number of new cases had been below the 1,000 mark in the last 21 days.
“We are studying the reasons. We will find if this is because of the relaxation of transportation,” said Dr. Jagadeesan.
The case fatality rate in the city was 1.95%, he added."
240,"The Madras High Court on Thursday relaxed restrictions imposed on physical hearing of cases in all trial courts across the State due to the threat posed by COVID-19. It enhanced the number of cases that could be listed and heard by every trial court from 10 to “at least” 20 a day from Monday.
The Administrative Committee, comprising top seven judges of the High Court, also permitted the entry of litigants as well as advocate clerks on the court campuses. The courts were allowed to let the accused surrender and entertain sureties by permitting them to enter the courts.
The decision was taken after most of the principal district judges in the State informed the Administrative Committee of unsatisfactory response to physical hearing from the lawyers because of the prohibition on the entry of litigants on the court campuses.
The committee, comprising Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justices Vineet Kothari, R. Subbiah, M. Sathyanarayanan, N. Kirubakaran, M.M. Sundresh and T.S. Sivagnanam, interacted with the principal district judges through video conferencing before taking the decision.
Separate time slots
It, however, ordered that separate time slots should be assigned for the appearance of litigants and sureties in order to avoid overcrowding and to maintain physical distancing norms.
The restrictions were not relaxed for the taluk court in Thriuthiraipoondi alone due to certain concerns.
Similarly, the Administrative Committee refused to relax the restrictions with respect to the courts in Puducherry and Karaikal, since the Chief Judge of the Union Territory reported that the death rate due to COVID-19 had increased.
The committee further resolved that a decision on opening bar association rooms, lawyers’ chambers and canteens in the court complexes would be taken after assessing the functioning of the courts with relaxed restrictions.
It further instructed the judicial officers across the State to ensure that service of summons and court notices were done by bailiffs and process servers using the NSTEP mobile app that had been provided in smartphones issued to them recently."

The contraband was being transported from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh in a mini lorry and a car. The police said there were eight members in the gang, and three of them had escaped.
The arrested are Shaul Hameed, 25, from Areekode; Akbar Ali, 32, from Manjeri; Abdurahman, 34, from Indianoor; Najeeb, 34, from Irumbuzhi, and Mohammed Irshad, 26, from Karipur.
The police waylaid the gang at Chapanangadi following a tip-off. The contraband was brought in eight sacks. While seven of them were hidden under sackfuls of onion in the mini lorry, one was recovered from the car.
The police have begun a hunt for the three members of the gang who are at large."
243,"Observing that the effectiveness of herbal concoction kabasura kudineer, a Siddha formulation for boosting immunity, had been recognised even on the floor of the Parliament, the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Centre to popularise it across the country.
Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan also directed the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) to come up with a roadmap on establishing at least one hospital per State for promoting all kinds of Indian systems of medicine.
The directions were issued after they expressed displeasure over the Ministry giving more importance to the promotion of Ayurveda, and not Siddha and Unani. The judges wanted all forms of medicines to be promoted equally across the country, without restricting them to specific regions.
They found that many posts in the cadre of adviser, joint adviser, deputy adviser, assistant adviser and medical officer had been sanctioned in the Ayurveda stream, and most of these posts had been filled up. Vacancies in the Ayurveda stream were relatively less.
On the other hand, fewer posts had been sanctioned in the Siddha and Unani streams, and a majority of those posts were vacant, the senior judge on the Bench said, wondering why Ayurveda alone was being treated as the “blue-eyed boy” of the Centre.
‘Restricted to T.N.’
Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan responded to this by stating that Ayurveda was being practised in most parts of the country, whereas Siddha was restricted to Tamil Nadu and parts of border States such as Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
He added that proposals had been sent recently to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for filling all vacancies. Not convinced with the submission, the judges observed that it was the duty of the Centre to promote Siddha across the country, without any restrictions. The judges suo motu impleaded the UPSC as one of the respondents to a case before them and directed it to explain by November 1 as to when it would be commencing the recruitment process by calling for applications and conducting written examinations.
The interim orders were passed on a habeas corpus petition filed against the detention of Chennai-based Siddha hospital administrator K. Thiruthanikachalam under the Goondas Act for releasing a video on social media accusing the government of ignoring his suggestions on treating COVID-19."

245,"With the northeast monsoon ahead and the pandemic around, the district administration has drawn up an action plan to contain any outbreak of vector-borne diseases, particularly dengue and chikungunya.
Though the figures available for the last nine months for both the vector-borne diseases show that cases during the period were less than those recorded during the corresponding months last year, the administration does not want to take a chance as a spike in dengue cases happens during the October-December period.
Last year, Puducherry recorded as many as 2,038 cases of dengue and around 797cases of chikungunya. So far this year, the region had reported, 564 dengue and 254 chikungunya cases.
District Collector-cum-Secretary (Health) T. Arun, who convened a meeting to review preparedness to deal with dengue on Wednesday, told The Hindu that the administration had decided to observe Friday as “dry day”.
On the day, coolers, flowerpots, birdbaths, water containers, stagnated water and other possible breeding grounds for Aedes mosquitoes responsible for transmitting dengue would be kept dry, he said.
“We appeal to the public, residents’ associations, non-governmental organisations and educational institutions to actively participate in the dry day. We need to contain the spread of dengue all the more now because of the pandemic. The mortality will be high if we have vector- borne diseases also,” he said.
The administration also planned to take massive cleaning and awareness programmes at containment zones at Kalapet, Sholai Nagar, Ariankuppam, Mettupalayam, Moolakulam, Oulgaret and Vanarapet areas.
“I have also given clear instructions to Public Works Department and Local Administration Department to clear all drains before the onset of monsoon,” the Collector said."
246,"Justifying the assertion made by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam that the protest planned by the Congress against the farm bills in the Union Territory would be counter-productive in containing COVID-19, Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Thursday said, “The MLA is right. This is clear undermining of the joint hard work being put in to contain the COVID spread.”
Responding to the letterby AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan, seeking action against Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for calling an agitation against the Centre on September 28, the Lieutenant Governor, in a WhatsApp message, said: “Disturbing the recovery by doing agitations will be highly detrimental and ill- timed.”
Joint efforts by ICMR, medical teams, officials and law enforcement agencies had led to a reduction in the positivity rate in the U.T., the Lt Governor said.
Earlier in the day, Mr.Anbalagan, in a letter to the Lt. Governor, had sought action against the Chief Minister for calling the agitation.
The Chief Minister who heads the State Disaster Management Authority would be violating the provisions of Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act if he intended to participate in the agitation. “I appeal to the Lt.Governor to immediately intervene and initiate action against the Chief Minister,” Mr.Anbalagan said.
He also appealed to the Union Home Minister to keep the Narayanasamy-led government on “suspended animation” for planning the agitation."
247,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday questioned the basis for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to praise Tamil Nadu’s efforts at combating COVID-19 and said that perhaps a discrete assessment by the Intelligence Bureau would bring out the ground reality.
In a statement issued here, he said Mr. Modi, who on Wednesday praised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for his handling of the pandemic, might get to know the truth about the State’s efforts and “the various scams in the procurement of medical equipment” if he conducted a discrete assessment by the Intelligence Bureau.
People’s welfare
“I hope the Prime Minister is really interested in the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu. If that is the case, he should take a broad view of the issue, instead of looking at it through the prism of the BJP’s alliance with the AIADMK, and see the truth for what it is — the State government’s massive failure in handling the pandemic, the doldrums the State’s economy is in, the unemployment in the State, the dissatisfaction of the middle class with the AIADMK government, the State’s fiscal deficit and the maladministration in the government, among other issues,” Mr. Stalin said.
The Leader of the Opposition said he wondered what the Chief Minister had done that warranted a certificate of appreciation from Mr. Modi.
Listing statistics related to the pandemic and the deaths it had caused, Mr. Stalin said he wondered if the Chief Minister had given Mr. Modi the right information.
“Just like how the BJP government at the Centre is a ‘no-data’ government, the Tamil Nadu government is either a ‘no-data’ government or a government that hides the real numbers. Afraid of disclosing the real number of COVID-19 deaths, the State government is providing false data and is hiding the truth from the people,” he said."

249,"Following the COVID-19 outbreak, I stocked up on sanitisers, N95 masks, and stayed at home during the lockdown. Yet, I somehow managed to contract the virus.
Thanks to my paranoia, I visited the hospital the minute I developed a cough and a temperature. But not even when I was advised to take the dreaded RT-PCR test did I fear the worst; after all, I had followed all the precautions to a tee.

Unfortunately, when the results came, I suddenly found myself in a hospital bed, which was to be my home for the next 15 days. The only contact I had with the outside world was with healthcare workers in personal protective equipment who attached an IV drip to my left hand and communicated with me in sign language.
I was riddled with anxiety about my family who now had to get checked. I heaved a huge sigh of relief when I received the news of their negative results a couple of days later.
The symptoms of COVID-19 hit me hard. I experienced intense fatigue; it felt like a freight train had hit me. I had frequent headaches that were like “thunderclaps inside the brain”, as The New York Times aptly described them. I had lung inflammation despite not being a smoker, and a persistent cough.
It is important to understand that unlike most diseases, recovering from COVID-19 is not a linear process. There were days when I woke up feeling perfectly normal, but within a few hours, I would be overcome by breathlessness and in need of an oxygen mask. I took 30 tablets a day, multiple blood tests, X-rays, CT scans, and lots of intravenous fluids.

However, it isn’t so much the physical symptoms as the the isolation which gets to you. With nobody allowed to visit and with no one to talk to (even doctors communicated only via video calls), the experience of being stuck in a room all alone was overwhelming.
After two weeks, the doctors felt I was stable enough to leave (though I still hadn’t tested negative). Since then, I have been in home quarantine, picking up plates of food that my parents leave outside my bedroom door, and checking my blood oxygen levels on the pulse oximeter. A few days earlier, despite my symptoms reducing drastically, I still tested positive, which only shows that recovery can be a slow and frustrating journey.
However, I have to say I am privileged and lucky: I got tested and got access to a hospital bed immediately after exhibiting symptoms, I have a comfortable room at home with family to help, and a job that allows me to work from home. Since I am a film correspondent, I get paid to review and keep track of all the movies and shows online. Watching episodes of Friends and The Office on Netflix as well as Vadivelu comedy scenes on YouTube was a great distraction for me during my time in hospital. I also recited lists of my favourite movies and football clubs every time the anxiety got too severe. Meanwhile, thousands of fellow journalists continue to brave the pandemic on a daily basis, reporting and going to office.
Every case of COVID-19 is unique. I read about a teenager who tested positive four times in a row, and a 90-year-old who have fought the virus in just a week. The virus doesn’t always follow a pattern. I still don’t know how I got infected, but my only advice would be this: stay at home as much as possible."
250,"The Madras High Court on Thursday stayed all further proceedings pursuant to fresh show cause notices issued to DMK president M.K. Stalin and 17 other MLAs of his party on September 7 for having allegedly breached the privileges of the Legislative Assembly by displaying gutkha (chewing tobacco) sachets there on July 19, 2017.
Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana held that the petitioners had made out a prima facie case for grant of interim relief and the balance of convenience was also in their favour.
She further ordered notice to the Speaker on the petitioners’ main plea to quash the showcause notices on grounds of perversity, illegality, mala fides and lack of jurisdiction.
The judge agreed with senior counsel R. Shunmugasundaram, N.R. Elango and Amit Anand Tiwari that Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy had on August 25 given a specific finding that possession and display of gutkha sachets were neither prohibited under law nor amounted to breach of privilege.
Disposing of an earlier batch of writ petitions filed by the MLAs challenging the previous show cause notices issued to them on August 28, 2017, for the same act, the first Division Bench had said that gutkha could not be equated to substances like narcotic drugs or liquor bottles, whose possession, per se, would be illegal and, therefore, might amount to breach of privilege.
‘Poor enforcement’
The Bench also pointed out that the intention of the MLAs in displaying the gutkha sachets in the Assembly was not to promote the substance whose manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution and sale was banned in the State. They only intended to exhibit the poor enforcement of the ban and the free availability of the substance in bunk shops.
“The above judgment of the Division Bench is not challenged by the respondents [Speaker, Assembly Secretary, Committee of Privileges] herein; instead, they have thought it fit to issue fresh show cause notices based on liberty granted by the Bench to deliberate upon the issue if the committee was still of the opinion that any breach had been committed,” Justice Sathyanarayana said.
In their challenge to the fresh notices through the present batch of cases, the MLAs contended that Rule 222 (1) of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Rules clearly stated that an issue of breach of privilege should be restricted to a specific matter of recent occurrence. Hence, fresh notices could not be issued in September for an event that occurred in July 2017, they argued.
The petitioners also said Rule 228 prohibited a person from being a member of the Committee of Privileges if he/she had a personal or direct interest of such a character that it may prejudicially affect the proceedings. In the present case, they objected to the presence of Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in the committee.
They pointed out that the Deputy Speaker had filed a defamation suit against Mr. Stalin in the High Court, claiming compensation of over ₹1 crore, and that all DMK MLAs had been opposing the continuance of Mr. Panneerselvam in the Cabinet, despite having voted against a confidence motion moved by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on February 18, 2017.
The presence of the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chief Minister in the present committee vitiated the entire proceedings, the petitioners said."
251,"One in every five persons in Puducherry district was infected with COVID-19 by August-end, the results of a Jipmer sero-survey have found.
The findings of the sero-survey, launched in two rounds in August and September, showed that between July-end and August, the antibody sero-prevalence showed a 4.2-fold increase.
This is in keeping with the 4.1-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases over the same period in Puducherry (from 2987 to 12,331), Jipmer said in a press note.
The first sero-survey had indicated that one in 20 persons in the district showed evidence of COVID-19 infection.
The second round data indicates that Puducherry had a high rate of transmission in August. Also, the prevalence of serological evidence with antibodies in the population is much higher than detected by RT-PCR as found at two time points; 19.6 (4.9/0.25) and 20.1 (20.7/1.03) fold respectively on July 30 and on August 30.
“Thus, by the end of August, nearly one-fifth of population in Puducherry had been infected with the Covid-19 infection,” the Jipmer release said.
According to the press note, two community-based serological surveys were conducted at intervals of four weeks in an attempt to find information on the extent of spread and trend of infection.
Blood samples were collected from randomly selected adults from 30 clusters in a ratio of 21 urban and 9 rural areas to replicate the population distribution in Puducherry. The two surveys were conducted during August 11-16 and September 10-16.
In the first round in August, 869 adults were tested and 43 (4.9%) had antibodies against SARS CoV-2 with a higher positivity in urban areas (5.7% versus 3.1%) and among women (6.3% versus 3.6%). The first round data reflects the cumulative proportion of Puducherry population infected as on July 30.
In the second round, of the 898 adults tested, 186 (20.7%) had antibodies against the SARS CoV-2 infection. In the second round, the positivity rate was similar in urban and rural population (20.7% versus 20.8%) and among men and women (21.4% versus 20%).
The second-round data reflects the cumulative proportion of Puducherry population which had been infected with COVID-19 as on August 30. The number of cases recorded in the district population on July 30 and August 30 respectively were 2,987 and 12,331 with incidence rates (population estimate for year 2020 is 12,00,000) of 0.25% and 1.03% respectively, the press note said."
252,"Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha of the Madras High Court on Thursday recused themselves from hearing a batch of cases related to the conduct of elections to the South Indian Artistes Association (SIAA), popularly known as Nadigar Sangam.
The judges directed the High Court Registry to list the case before some other Division Bench. The decision was taken after the warring groups refused to arrive at a consensus on either counting the votes of elections already held or to hold fresh elections.
The administration of Nadigar Sangam had turned murky after complaints were made by some members to the Registrar of Societies in 2019 that actors Vishal, Nasser and Karthi had no right to continue as office-bearers after the completion of their three-year tenure.
Immediately, the former office-bearers moved a writ petition in the High Court and obtained permission from Justice P.D. Audikesavalu to conduct the elections on June 23, 2019. However, the judge ordered that the votes should not be counted till the final disposal of the case. After taking it up for final hearing, Justice K. Kalyanasundaram set aside the election already held and ordered fresh elections. Aggrieved over such an order, the former office-bearers moved a writ appeal before the Division Bench.
When the appeal, along with a few other civil suits, were listed before the Bench led by Justice Sundresh, it directed the parties to attempt a compromise whereby both could agree either for counting the votes already cast or to hold fresh elections.
However, on Thursday, they reported back that no such compromise could be reached with the former office-bearers not agreeing for a fresh election and the other faction not willing to accept the counting of votes that were already cast."
253,"The aim is to bring down the State’s case fatality rate to less than 1%, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.
During a media interaction after the inspection of a COVID-19 control room, the Minister said that efforts taken in the State had borne results. Tracking, tracing and testing the infected had helped bring down the positivity rate to 6.4%, he said.
According to him, the positivity rate had fallen to less than 10%. The Minister said that this was as per guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research. “Our aim is to bring down the positivity rate to 5%. The case fatality rate was initially at 1.6%, on average. We have managed to reduce it gradually to 1.4%, and this week, it has further come down to 1.2%,” he said.
“From an average of 129 persons losing their lives due to COVID-19 every day, we have reduced the number of people dying of the infection to less than 70. We want to bring down the case fatality rate to less than 1%,” he added.
Dr. Vijayabaskar attributed the improvement in recovery rate, now at 90.2%, to the focus on building medical infrastructure, besides the use of life-saving medicines and treatment modalities adopted by the State.
The State has, so far, spent ₹1,982.9 crore on COVID-19-related activities, including on treatment and the development of infrastructure, he said."

“What I am going to talk about is something that, in my wildest dreams, I never thought I would be discussing.  And that is the need to make certain that the President of the United States, if he loses this election, will abide by the will of the voters and leave office peacefully,” Mr. Sanders said during his speech ‘Saving American Democracy’ at George Washington University, here in Washington DC. Mr. Sanders remarks came a day after Mr. Trump, when questioned at a press briefing, would not commit to the peaceful transfer of power.
“I think it is terribly important that we actually listen to, and take seriously, what Donald Trump is saying,” Mr. Sanders said.

Trump will accept results of free-and-fair presidential polls, says White House
 “This is not just an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy – and democracy must win,” said Mr. Sanders, who is an independent senator from Vermont and was the candidate of choice for progressives.
“With less than 6 weeks left to go in this campaign it is my fervent hope that all Americans – Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, moderates, conservatives – come together to defend American democracy, our constitution and the rule of law. We must ensure, in this unprecedented moment in American history that this is an election that is free and fair…” Mr. Sanders said.
He called Mr. Trump a “pathological liar” with “strong authoritarian tendencies” and someone who is willing to undermine democracy to stay in power.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated conspiracy theories around vote by mail, claiming that Democrats are using it to commit voter fraud. Mr. Sanders cited several pieces of research – including from Republican and conservative sources – to demonstrate the very low incidence of voter fraud in the U.S.
Mr. Sanders listed a series of ways in which Mr. Trump, according to him, was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the elections.
“Trump has also urged his supporters to become, quote, ‘poll watchers,’ but what he is really saying is he wants his supporters, some of whom are members of armed militias, to intimidate voters,” Mr. Sanders said.
The senator described a hypothetical scenario in which Mr. Trump has a lead on the evening of November 3, but loses as postal ballots are counted. At which point – in Mr. Sanders’s example – Mr. Trump would say the postal ballots were invalid and claim victory.
“Furthermore, in states where Republicans control the legislature, it is possible that the election results will be ignored because of false accusations of voter fraud,” Mr. Sanders said, echoing another concern of Democrats.
One of the ways to counter these possibilities, Mr. Sanders said, was voter turnout (higher turnouts have traditionally benefitted Democrats).
“As someone who is strongly supporting Joe Biden, let’s be clear: A landslide victory for Biden will make it virtually impossible for Trump to deny the results and is our best means for defending democracy,” he said."

Though the passage of the ‘farm Bills’ in Parliament raises certain questions on the working of democratic processes, especially under the present government, the onus lies on the Opposition to make a sincere effort to inform the stakeholders — through online platforms and other forms of media — about what it perceives to be the adverse impact of the Bills in the short, medium and long term. Vague allegations about the commercialisation of agriculture, akin to what happened under British colonial policy which forced the farmer to grow indigo, will not fetch the desired results. The Opposition cannot expect an Indigo revolt in the 21st century without adequate mobilisation through sustained, systematic communication lines and the grass-root level participation of farmers and social organisations.

Cartoon in The Hindu
It appears that top officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) have unnecessarily taken offence over the cartoon appearing in The Hindu (OpEd page, September 22), about the state of affairs in the FCI (‘Letters to the Editor’, September 24). The cartoon in question is open to multiple interpretations. To my mind, the cartoonist intended to convey a covert message through the cartoon with rats or rodents who appear to rattled by the farm Bills. The rodents represent not just the four-legged ones but presumably also the two-legged ones. While what the four-legged ones account for may be just pilferage, the loss by way of theft by the two-legged ones may run into millions of tons . The FCI may be well equipped to minimise the losses, but the same thing cannot be said about the two-legged ones as there may be a network actively involved in rackets whose ingenuity to outsmart any surveillance and detection is just fantastic. Moreover, in the backdrop, one sees an FCI signboard which has been scored out and written with a line that says ‘Private Warehouse’. One has to take into account the totality of the elements of a cartoon to make sense of it. Contrary to what the FCI letter claims about the high standards of storage and maintenance of FCI warehouses, reports of damage to foodgrains, pilferage and even thefts are not uncommon. A long time, a leading news daily even published a shocking story of what it called the ‘great grain robbery’, forcing the government on the backfoot. I do not claim to have decoded the cartoon in question but all I am suggesting is that the cartoon is not just about four-legged rodents. However, only the cartoonist should be able to clarify it. Perhaps the Readers’ Editor, The Hindu should ask the cartoonist to step in when there is a sharp criticism of his work.

Drug abuse and drug peddling should be dealt with seriously. Some Members of Parliament who were once film actors themselves should not be possessive or defensive about alleged drug use in Bollywood as they must remember that their days in the film industry were vastly different from what it is now. Many actors alleged to be involved with narcotics are also ‘role models’ and ‘ambassadors’. They too must realise the impact they will have on society and youth. The message must be clear —say no to drugs and drug abuse.

COVID-19 and after
With only a vaccine to our aid, we cannot breathe easy till mid-2023 — the year when we can start measuring the benefit of total pan-India vaccination, provided we work with super efficiency and focus. Our daily case counts will continue indefinitely even if we keep to the 10-lakh testing level. We are in the 1918 trap now, with no vaccine and no medicines. But unlike 1918, we have advanced medicinal chemistry. We need to rid society of fear, without which a revival is difficult.

261,"Health facilities are a place of healing and restoration. But can they be places of harm as well? The world over, one in 10 patients experiences or is subject to harm in health-care settings. These range from operations done on the wrong patient, to injections being administered in an unsafe manner. Studies in India have shown that more than two-thirds of injections are given in an unsafe manner; equally worrying is the fact that over two-thirds of injections in primary care are unnecessary in the first place.
Global focus
To highlight this important issue, the World Health Organization observes World Patient Safety Day every year (September 17). The theme for 2020 was ‘Health Worker Safety: A Priority for Patient Safety’ with a call to action to ‘Speak up for health worker safety!’ But one may wonder, why, on a day dedicated for patient safety, we should speak up for health worker safety? So, why is health worker safety important for patient safety?
Editorial | Protection for protectors: On safety of healthcare workers
Much harm done to patients in health-care settings is because of unsafe health-care practice and unsafe health-care communication. Unsafe health-care practice refers to unsafe or unnecessary procedures, wrong medications, medications given in a wrong dosage, etc. Unsafe health-care communication refers to mistakes made in health-care settings due to miscommunication between health professionals, for example, during patient handover in between staff shifts. The quality of both practice and communication is dependent on the safety and well-being of health workers. For example, numerous studies have shown that health workers, such as residents, who have been on duty for more than 24 hours at a stretch, have a higher risk of making mistakes, increasing the likelihood of a direct impact on patient safety.
COVID-19 and reporting cases
During the current COVID-19 crisis, health workers are not only putting in longer hours but also working under increasingly difficult circumstances, which affect both their physical and mental health. The mental health of health workers is linked to the workplace culture. Some organisations have a culture of supporting staff, responding to their needs and encouraging learning from mistakes; while others have a culture of fault-finding, blame, guilt and abuse. When instances of patient harm occur, whether people feel encouraged to report them, depends on the organisation’s culture and leadership.
Without reporting, it is difficult for organisations to learn from mistakes and create systems, such as check lists in order to prevent similar future occurrences. In addition, in India, it is not uncommon to find health-care organisations observe strict hierarchies between specialties, between designations, and between doctors and other health professionals, such as nurses. Such power differences can further prevent reporting and cooperative organisational learning and may, in fact, increase chances of abuse: verbal, physical, emotional and sexual, putting the safety of health workers and patients at risk.

Looking at the organisation
Organisational learning is more important than individual learning. This is because instances of patient harm, even when they occur at the individual level, are often an end result of a chain of organisational failures.
For example, systemic under staffing, lack of reporting mechanisms, lack of dedicated time for hand overs, audits, training and team building, poorly maintained equipment and corruption in purchases, are all organisational failures that could result in a cascade leading to avoidable harm to the patient. Moreover, good systems can mitigate the effects of individual mistakes.
Thus, it is pertinent to look beyond the individual to look at the organisation as the sum of multiple elements that interact with each other. This involves taking a systems approach. What does that involve? Let us take the example of overcrowding. In many hospitals, quality of care is often compromised because of overcrowding, such as in the emergency department. To take a systems approach in this situation would mean looking at it holistically — for example, from at least three angles using the input-throughput-output conceptual model described by Asplin et al in the Annals of Emergency Medicine in 2003.
Editorial | Do no harm: on safety of health care workers
One, the input: looking at whether patients who come to the emergency department need to be there in the first place or could be managed somewhere else such as in the community itself. Two, the throughput: looking at whether there are inefficiencies such as shortage of doctors, nurses, equipment or space that is increasing the time taken for patients to be treated. And three, the output: looking at whether the patients are staying longer in the emergency department than required because of lack of non-emergency department inpatient beds, delays at the pharmacy or delays in transportation of patients out of the emergency department.
The conversation on health during COVID-19 has often centred on individuals, with certain individuals, such as health-care workers, seen as heroes, and others (including those referred to as ‘super spreaders’ in a stigmatising way), seen as villains. Many health workers have demonstrated excellence despite the limitations in the Indian health system. This is laudable but may not be sustainable. Creating sustainability would involve taking a systems approach to make sure all parts of the system, both of health care and of supportive social care are well functioning.
Also read | Why health care workers above 60 should be ‘benched’
Many health workers are overworked not by choice, but rather the lack of it since understaffing and shortages are a common feature of the Indian public health-care system. In addition, India simply does not have enough health facilities to cater to all its population, even without a pandemic. Further, the lack of adequate social care, such as care homes, community health services and community-based rehabilitative and palliative services, unduly increase the burden on health-care facilities.
Stakeholder involvement
Finally, a systems approach involves all stakeholders. Patients themselves need to be aware of patient safety as well as be empowered to demand safe health care and resist unnecessary medications and procedures. Hospital managers must understand the need for and be empowered to create systems of reporting, monitoring and organisational learning. Policy makers must prioritise staffing, co-designing functional and safe workplaces, and ethics in health care.

Numerous persons find healing and restoration in health care. But some are harmed as well. In crises such as COVID-19, quality of care can be compromised further. We can help improve patient safety by taking a systems approach and promoting a culture of health worker safety and well-being.

Many such cases were pending due to the delay in obtaining forensic test results. The PSC should implement the Supreme Court order of September 9 in this regard, said a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly.
The counsel for the PSC contended that there was a delay in conducting recruitment tests due to the COVID-19 situation.

263,"S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, who died in Chennai on Friday at the age of 74, rendered over 100 songs in Malayalam, and some of them topped the charts too.
But it wasn't those songs that endeared him to music fans here. It was rather his hits in Tamil that made him such a favourite, especially in live shows, across the towns and villages of Kerala.
It, in fact, would be no exaggeration to say that he, along with Ilaiyaraaja, the composer who worked with him most, played a big role in making Tamil songs popular with Malayalis.
Instant hit
Some of the Tamil songs of P. Susheela, who took no time to establish as the leading singer in Malayalam cinema, had attracted the Malayali ear much earlier, but it was with the rise of SPB that the interest grew rapidly.
Yes, A.R. Rahman and Roja made even more people in this part of the world discover Tamil film music in the early 1990s, but Ilaiyaraaja and SPB had already created a base.
Back in the '80s and '90s – when there was no YouTube to keep you entertained with endless streaming of music and that too on mobile phones – the live music shows, or ganamelas, used to be the biggest attractions of festivals at temples or churches.
Every troupe used to have a singer who specialised in singing SPB’s songs – often the foot-tapping ones – and if they didn't have, they would borrow someone from another troupe.
Then, in 1980, came Sankarabharanam. The unlikely box-office winner about classical music and dance saw SPB in a new light. His songs, like Sankara nadasareera para..., Omkara nadanu.., and Dorakuna ituvanti seva..., also introduced many a Malayali to Carnatic music.
In Malayalam
At a time when K.J. Yesudas and P. Jayachandran reigned supreme, music directors in Malayalam cinema rarely needed to look elsewhere for a male voice elsewhere. Still, SPB could boast a sizeable number of hits in Malayalam, too.
He had made a sparkling debut under the baton of G. Devarajan, the greatest composer in Malayalam, for the 1969 film Kadalpalam. Ee kadalum... was a fine song too, but it was overshadowed by the film's other songs Ujjayiniyile gaayika... (P. Leela) and the Kasthoori thailamittu... (Madhuri).
His popular songs in Malayalam include Tharapatham... (Anaswaram), Ootti pattanam... (Kilukkam), Kakkala Kannamma... (Yathramozhi) and Manje vaa.. (Thusharam)."

The accused have been identified as then Joint Secretary S.P. Rana, Assistant Secretaries Babita Rani and Shikha Tomar and Assistant Programmer Ruchin Tomar. In December 2019, the CBI instituted a preliminary inquiry into the allegations against them.
According to the CBI, Ms. Rani and Mr. Tomar – both from the Jat community – were recruited under the OBC category between 2012 and 2014, in violation of the rules. Mr. Rana also allegedly helped Ms. Tomar, the daughter-in-law of his brother, get the job in 2012 on the basis of fake experience certificate from a Gurugram-based company.
Dismissed from service
The FIR alleges that Mr. Rana, who was then holding the charge of Joint Secretary (Admin & Legal) in the CBSE, made repeated recommendations while processing the application of Ms. Rani in 2012. The selection was made under his supervision. He also allowed Ms. Rani's request for not verifying her credentials. The CBSE dismissed her from service in January.
The CBSE had also issued a charge sheet against Ms. Tomar for major penalty proceedings. She has not been reporting to duty and is not responding to the memorandums issued by the Board.
It is alleged that Mr. Tomar was appointed in 2014 on a forged engineering degree. He did not submit original mark-sheets to the CBSE despite repeated reminders and was terminated in January 2019.
Besides, the CBI has alleged that Mr. Rana had allowed overpayment of ₹26.92 lakh to KPMG for its outsourced services for the processing of applications seeking affiliation/upgrade of schools. During the inquiry, the CBSE was not able to provide the original file for the award of contract to KPMG.

The farmers also feared that the new laws will help the big business houses to buy their land and reduce them to farm workers. The farmers also said these laws are like the return of the East India Company, to which Mr. Gandhi quipped, “There was an East India Company, now there is a West India company.”
“These laws will have to be opposed for the future of India. A farmer’s voice has immense strength; it was the farmer’s voice that helped us win our freedom. And farmer’s protests will get us freedom again,” he said.

268,"A large number of fish died and floated in the water in Saravana Poigai, the temple tank of Subramaniaswamy Temple at Tirupparankundram here on Friday.
Executive Officer of the temple M. Ramasamy said the dead fish started floating from Thursday night. “The temple staff removed the dead fish on Friday morning. We have also closed the pond for public use,” he said.
The number of dead fish removed on Friday was lower when compared to thousands of fish that were found dead in the pond in 2016. “Still, water samples were lifted and sent to the Central Pollution Control Board, TWAD Board and the Fisheries department to assess the quality of water and find the cause of death,” he said.
Hundreds of devotees visit the Saravana Poigai every day to have a holy dip in the pond. Despite holding religious importance, the water in the pond is fully contaminated and is unfit for bathing.
An official from the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments department said devotees and residents often washed their clothes using detergents with powerful chemicals which led to water pollution. “Though we have been repeatedly telling the devotees to stop using detergents, soaps and shampoos, they just defied,” he said.
As a measure to restore the pond, Madurai Corporation is building toilets and bathrooms for men and women. A common washing facility is also being constructed near the tank. These amenities are constructed through Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore's constituency development fund.
“Around 25% of the work has been completed. After total completion, devotees will be restricted from taking bath in the pond. They can only sprinkle water on themselves,” said an official.
Mr. Ramasamy said the HR and CE Department is working with Baba Atomic Research Centre to clean and restore the waterbody. “An additional motor, which helps to pump more dissolved oxygen into the water, has been installed after the Friday's incident,” he added."
269,"Draw of lots for the allocation of reservations in wards ahead of the local body elections in the State will be held from September 28 to October 6 in various centres, State Election Commissioner V. Bhaskaran said on Friday.
The draw of lots in the 941 grama panchayats and 86 municipalities will be held from September 28 to October 1. The exercise will be conducted for the 152 block panchayats and 14 district panchayats on October 5.
The draw will be held in the Kozhikode and Kannur Corporations on September 28; in the Kochi and Thrissur Corporations on September 30 and the Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam Corporations on October 6.
District Collectors will supervise the draws in the three-tier panchayats. The Joint Director, Urban Affairs, will control the exercise in the municipalities, while the Director, Urban Affairs, will oversee the process in corporations.
Reservations in five categories - women, SC women, ST women, SC and ST - have to be finalised through the draws. Reservation for women stands at 50%. The SC/ST reservations are determined on the basis of the population of the two communities.
All wards that were not reserved for women in 2015 will be earmarked for reservation this time.
Wards reserved for SC women, ST women, will be decided from the wards reserved for women. Wards reserved for these two categories will be decided by excluding those wards that were reserved for SC/ST communities in 2010 and 2015.
Lots will be drawn for determining the SC/ST reservation wards after finalising the wards reserved for the women."
270,"Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Friday termed the chain of events leading to the suspension of eight Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha on Monday and the subsequent boycott of both Houses of Parliament by the Opposition “unfortunate”.The “dignity of the House and its Chair” was “an important aspect of the Parliamentary system and it is the duty of all members to respect it,” he noted at a press conference in New Delhi.

The tradition of Parliament was not to refer to the goings-on in the other House but that it would suffice to say that the events thereof had been unfortunate, he said.
He, however, observed that the boycott of the Lok Sabha by the Opposition was largely under political compulsions. “In the Lok Sabha, the Opposition has largely extended cooperation to the Chair in the peaceful conduct of the House, and the boycott was, as I understand it, under an act of political compulsion,” he said. “I had asked the leaders of the Opposition parties in the Lok Sabha to tea after they announced the boycott, and tried to persuade them to reconsider at least for the last sitting, but these were decisions taken under political compulsions,” he added.
Unprecedented event
The suspended Rajya Sabha members had, in an unprecedented event, gone on an overnight strike within the Parliament premises after their suspension was announced by House Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu. Deputy chairperson Harivansh, who had been at the receiving end of the Opposition fury in the House and who was accused of passing the substantive Farm related Bills in the House without division and without the House being in order had also undertaken a day-long fast.
Will the farm bills benefit farmers?
The Opposition in the Lok Sabha, where the Bills were cleared prior to being tabled in the Rajya Sabha and that too with more than five hours debate, had boycotted the proceedings in solidarity with the eight suspended MPs.

Mr. Birla, while giving details of the productivity of the Lok Sabha, said that it had breached a record on that score, with 167% productivity. Members through various avenues open to them had debated various important issues.
Border stand-off issue
When asked as to why a debate on the border stand-off with China was not debated in the House, he said coronavirus (COVID-19) was the most challenging problem facing the country and that issue had been debated not just during a general debate on the issue but also during debates on amendments to the epidemic diseases Act.
The construction work on a new parliament complex had almost started and would be completed in 21 months. The Lok Sabha secretariat was prepared to hold both the winter session and Budget session of Parliament, he stated.
While the Rajya Sabha secretariat saw 83 staffers coming down with COVID-19 during the monsoon session, Mr Birla, while admitting that the Lok Sabha secretariat had not escaped the disease, refused to disclose any numbers, terming such disclosure “unseemly.”"

In a meeting organised by the Janatantra Samaj in Dharwad on Friday to discuss the plans for Monday’s agitation, the office-bearers of 30 different organisations expressed their support to the agitation.
Social activist and president of Citizens For Democracy S.R. Hiremath chaired the meeting which was attended by members and office-bearers of like-minded organisations. The participants expressed displeasure over the State government’s anti-labour and anti-farmer policies and emphasised the need to oppose the move strongly.
Mr. Hiremath said that the recent amendments to various bills pertaining to farmers and the working class would adversely affect their life and also the farm sector. The organisations would support the bandh call and would also continue fighting the government for any move against the people, he said.

Swapna has disclosed about the possible passwords during the custodial interrogation and the information has been communicated to the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing for imaging, the agency submitted in its remand extension report submitted to the NIA Special Court on Friday.
However, the report is silent on the interrogation of M. Sivasankar, the former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister. The bureaucrat was questioned by the agency for over eight hours at its Kochi office on Thursday.
Swapna had to be further interrogated to examine the contents of the digital devices that were obtained. Her custodial interrogation is required considering the fact that the crime committed by her has international ramifications and she is one of the prime conspirators in the case. The incriminating materials found in other digital devices need to be argued with the accused, the NIA said.
The court extended the remand of the accused till October 9.

275,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached a London-based property currently worth ₹127 crore, linked to Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor, in connection with a money laundering case. The total attachment now stands at ₹2,011 crore.
The residential flat, located on South Audley Street in London, was bought in 2017 for 9.9 million pound (about ₹93 crore) in the name of DOIT Creations Jersey Limited, of which Mr. Kapoor is allegedly the beneficial owner.
“Information from a reliable source revealed that Rana Kapoor is trying to alienate this property in London and that he has hired a reputed property consultant. Enquiries from open sources confirmed that this property has been listed for sale on several websites,” said the ED on Friday.
Its probe against Mr. Rana and others is based on an FIR registered by the CBI, which alleged that in April-June 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in the short-term debentures of DHFL.
Kickback payment
Simultaneously, Kapil Wadhawan of DHFL allegedly paid a kickback of ₹600 crore to Mr. Kapoor and his family members in the garb of a loan to DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited.
Yes Bank had also sanctioned a loan of ₹750 crore to RKW Developers, a group company of DHFL beneficially owned by Mr. Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan and their family members. The loan was for a Bandra reclamation project, but the entire amount was allegedly siphoned off through shell companies.
Mr. Kapoor, Mr. Kapil Wadhawan and Mr. Dheeraj Wadhawan were arrested by the ED and they are currently in judicial custody.
The ED had attached properties worth ₹1,411 crore related to the Wadhawan brothers. In a separate case involving Mr. Kapoor, assets worth ₹307 were attached. The agency has also filed charge sheets against the accused persons."

277,"Kerala’s borrowing has increased substantially by 112% to meet its high expenditure needs. A fall in revenue receipts to the tune of ₹81,180.5 crore from the budget estimate of ₹1,14,636 crore is predicted during 2020-2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 on the State economy.
The State’s revenue deficit will be ₹33,333.9 crore even after obtaining the full revenue deficit grant of ₹15,323 crore from the 15th Finance Commission. To meet the budgeted revenue expenditure and the additional expenses necessitated by COVID-19, the State has to resort to borrowing. With the enhancement of borrowing limit of States from 3% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to 5%, the State is to get a fiscal space of ₹18,087 crore.
The delay of the Union government in filling the revenue gap through the timely disbursement of the Good and Service Tax (GST) compensation has adversely affected the fiscal space of the State.
Fiscal deficit figured as per the accounts during 2018-2019 is 3.4% of the GSDP which is above the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) ceiling of 3%, according to L. Anitha Kumary and N. Ramalingam, Associate Professors, Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT).
Though this is budgeted as 3% during the next two years, the experts say in the analysis titled “Dwindling revenue and galloping expenditure in pandemic times” that due to COVID-19 impact, the likelihood of not meeting the target is more.
Tax revenue hit
A flat 30% fall of revenue receipt has been noted in the provisional accounts. The State has lost ₹5,715 crore in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Tax revenue within the revenue receipt has seriously hit by a shortfall of 51% due to the lockdown.
The revenue expenditure has swelled by 15% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. A rise of 66.7% in the case of subsidy expenditure and 21.8% in capital expenditure has been noted along with the borrowings going up by 112%.
Revenue deficit up
Revenue deficit has shot up disturbingly to 138.9% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Fiscal deficit shows an alarmingly 112.9% during the first three months of 2020. For the State, mobilisation of own revenue has become a pressing issue."

Kuckian, were among those who took part in the protest.
Activists said that the Union and State governments were acting against the interests of farmers and workers. The two governments are making Acts and bringing amendments that favour capitalists. The two governments were acting in an authoritarian way and have no regard for democratic practices, they added.
The activists blocked the movement of vehicles coming towards the city for a brief period by sitting on the National Highway near the busy Nantoor Junction. Then, they held a protest meeting by the roadside.
Among the activists who took part in the protest included those from Social Democratic Party of India, All India Trade Union Congress, Centre of Indian Trade Unions, Indian National Trade Union Congress, Dalit Sangharsh Samiti, Students Federation of India and National Students Union of India.
Similar protests were held in Belthangady, Puttur, Sullia and Bantwal and also in Udupi.
In Hassan
Farmers staged a protest in Hassan on Friday demanding that the Union and State governments withdraw what they said anti-farmer bills. They opposed the amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act brought by the State government and the Union government’s bill curtailing the power of the APMCs.
Under the banner of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, hundreds of farmers took out a march from the Hemavati Statue Circle to the Deputy Commissioner’s office in the city. The protesters said that both the governments had been implementing anti-farmers decisions. The new laws would sound the death knell to the farming community as they will lose their right over their land as well as produces they grow gradually due to the anti-farmer laws, they said.
The recent decision of the those in power had shown that capitalist forces had been influencing the administration. When the farming sector had been suffering because of the COVID-19 situation, the anti-farmer bills would hit them hard, said Anekere Ravi, vice-president of KRRS.
Leaders of pro-farmer organisations Mehaboob Pasha, Shivarame Gowda, Naveen Kumar and others took part in the protest."

287,"An upgrade of 90 medium lift Mi-17 helicopters of the Indian Air Force (IAF) proposed in 2002 could not be achieved even after 18 years, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said as a result of which these “helicopters were flying with limited capability, thus compromising operational preparedness during these years” and the expenditure of about ₹223 crore was “not justified” with limited life left in 56 of them.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) concluded a contract with Elbit Systems of Israel for the upgrade of the 90 copters at ₹618.23 crore in January 2017. “After upgradation, 56 of these helicopters would be left with less than two years of life. The expenditure of ₹222.92 crore being incurred on their upgradation is not justified,” the CAG said in a report tabled in Parliament early this week.
The 56 helicopters would be phased out by 2024. In addition, for the upgradate, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and Bharat Electronics Limited were to supply ₹1,720 crore worth of essential components. Contract had yet not been concluded between the MoD and HAL, BEL for this supply. “Thus even after 18 years, upgradation of the helicopters has not been completed.”
Of the 90 copters, 56 were inducted into the IAF between 1984-89 and have a Total Calendar Life of 35 years.
Certain limitations
The Mi-17 and Mi-17 1V helicopters of the IAF had certain limitations in operating in adverse weather, night conditions and in electronic warfare dense battlefield. Due to this, the IAF initiated the proposal to upgrade 172 helicopters in 2002 and the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) was accorded by the Defence Acquisition Council in 2005. But the Request For Proposal was not issued even after two years as the IAF could not finalise the number of copters to be upgraded. After a series of delays, during which few helicopters were lost in accidents, a contract for the upgradate of 90 was signed with Elbit systems.
The report said that as per the contract, the two prototypes of each type of helicopter, Mi-17 and Mi-17 1V, would be upgraded by Elbit systems and delivered by July 2018 and January 2019 respectively.
The remaining 86, 54 Mi-17 and 32 Mi-17 1V, would thereafter be upgraded indigenously with transfer of technology from the vendor. For this, certain components and sub-systems were to be procured by HAL and BEL. “This involved an additional cost of ₹1,720 crore, the contract for which has not been concluded yet (June 2020),” the report stated."
288,"JD(S) leader H. D. Kumaraswamy on Friday said Congress has not consulted his party about bringing a no-confidence motion against Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka and expressed doubts over the seriousness behind such a move.
The former Chief Minister even suggested that it could well be for publicity.
“Till this moment Congress leaders have not discussed with us about the no-confidence motion. When it comes before us we will decide,”he told reporters in response to a question on supporting the no-confidence motion against the government.
Asked whether JD(S) has confidence in this government, he said, enjoying the confidence of the people was more important than that of his party.
”...I don’t know how serious they (Congress) are about it (no-confidence motion).
If they were serious about moving a no-confidence motion, they would have discussed it with us earlier itself.
Whether they have done it for publicity or they really want to move a no-confidence in this given situation, I’m not aware,” he added.
Mr. Kumaraswamy felt the atmosphere was not suitable for such an exercise, given the flood related issues, COVID-19 pandemic and the financial situation.
“In such a difficult situation, every public representative has to fulfil their responsibility. I say this to both the ruling and opposition side,” he said.
Signalling another political bout, a notice by opposition Congress, expressing no-confidence in the Yediyurappa-led government was admitted by Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri on Thursday.
The no-confidence motion and discussion in this regard is likely to be taken up on Saturday.
The ruling BJP has termed the Congress’ move as a “political gimmick” and said the opposition party lacks numbers.
With the numbers on its side posing no threat to the stability of the government because of this no-confidence motion, the Congress may use the debate to point out alleged failures of the government.
In the 225-member assembly, the ruling BJP has 116 members, Congress 67, JD(S) 33, BSP and nominated 1, independents 2, and Speaker (he has a casting vote).

In a letter to Dakshina Kannada MP and State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel last week, Mr. Mandaviya has said that the Directorate General of Lighthouse and Lightships has finalised the architectural design for the improvement project, Mr. Kateel said in a statement here on Friday.
The MP had written to the Minister in August last regarding the development of the lighthouse.
Mr. Mandaviya said that the development project involves several works. The lighthouse would get a capsule lift to facilitate the movement of tourists to the top of the structure. There would also be a connecting bridge from the ground to the lift.
A public entry gate, a security cabin and a ticketing counter would be provided under the project. The ground floor of the existing building would be converted into a gallery, while the lighthouse operations would be shifted to the first floor, Mr. Mandaviya said.
The surroundings of the lighthouse would witness landscaping, hardscaping and lighting besides getting a play area for children. A proper approach from the lighthouse to the beach too would be provided under the improvement project.
Thanking the Ministry for proposing the improvement project, Mr. Kateel said that the lighthouse, already a landmark in Mangaluru, would attract more number of people once the improvement project was completed. He recalled that the structure was built between 1969 and 1972 atop a huge rock close to the Sadashiva Mahaganapathi Temple.
The lighthouse beach, also called NITK beach, attracts thousands of visitors during the weekends because of the shallow and relatively safe waters. However, not many people visit the lighthouse because of the absence of facilities."

He claimed that all the provisions made in the Bills are anti-farmer and the mandis will be destroyed.
“Why was the law made? Why was the minimum support price (MSP) not proposed? You can understand from it that the situation is very serious and the way these three bills were passed, it was also done in a shameful manner,” Gehlot told reporters.
Attacking the government, he claimed, “These are people of fascist thinking and they do not believe in democracy. All the work is being done so that public attention can be diverted.”
He said the Bills were introduced without consulting mandi traders and Opposition parties.
The Chief Minister said that it took 40-50 years for mandis to be established and the government took a decision to uproot them without consulting the traders in order to give benefit to big capitalists.

297,"The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation on Friday clarified in the Supreme Court that Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) does not recognise private arrangements made between tour operators and airlines for advance bulk ticket bookings.
The government and the regulator’s duty is towards the passengers named in the “passenger manifest”. Passengers, whose flights were cancelled during lockdown, should not be forced to run from pillar to post or behind tour operators for their refund, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted before a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan.
Bulk bookings
The government was responding to concerns raised by travel agents and tour operators, who said they usually pay a lump-sum amount from their own pockets to book these tickets in bulk. The cancelled flights during lockdown has caused them a huge loss. They had objected to the government’s refund proposal recommending payment of ticket money directly to the passengers. Tour operators and travel agents complained that not only have they lost their money but would now be expected to run behind passengers to get it back.
“This lump-sum payment of money by a travel agent or a corporate house on behalf of his client to the airlines, either in advance or after availing the flight services, is not recognised as a contract of purchase of tickets under the CARs. They remain in the realm of private contract between the parties,” Mr. Mehta referred to an affidavit filed jointly for the Ministry and DGCA clarifying their stand in the issue.
“The CARs recognise only those tickets, which are actually issued by the airline in the name of a known and identified traveller, who is either the client of the travel agent or an employee of a corporate house,” government said.
However, a suggestion came out during the discussion that passengers could transfer the credit shell into the tour operator’s name.
The proposed refund policy placed on record in court entails airlines to open credit shells in the names of passengers. Passengers can use the credit shell to fly any route. The credit is transferable to anyone. If the credit is not used, the ticket amount has to be mandatorily returned to the passenger by March 31, 2021. The passengers are also entitled to the incentive of an increase of .75% in the value of their shells if the credit remains untouched till March 31, 2021.
The court was hearing a petition filed by NGO, Pravasi Legal Cell, represented by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Jose Abraham, on the plight of passengers whose flights were cancelled when the national lockdown following the pandemic saw flights grounded.
Deadline untenable
During the hearing, senior advocate Arvind Datar, for a private airline, objected to the March 31, 2021 deadline.
“We will refund the money to passengers, but March 31 is impossible. This will take a toll on our employees. This is a very difficult time. Your Lordships may consider extending the time by another six months or more,” Mr. Datar submitted.
“But as per CAR, no time is permitted at all. Refund should be immediate,” Justice R. Subhash Reddy observed.
“You have to pay,” Justice Bhushan agreed.
“We will pay. But give some more time. My employees also need to be paid,” Mr. Datar responded.
The court finally reserved the case for judgment."

As the farmers’ associations have called for ‘Karnataka Bandh’ on Monday (September 28) on the issues concerning the farmers, Friday’s protest was symbolic in many places with the protesters restricting their agitation to blocking national highways at various points. In some places the police took some of them into custody to clear the traffic and later released them.
During the protest staged by farmers near Rayapur located between Hubballi and Dharwad, the police took KPCC media analyst P.H. Neeralakeri and others into custody after they insisted on continuing the hour-long road blockade. Former MLA N.H. Konaraddi was part of the protest. Police led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Anusha cleared the Hubballi-Dharwad road. Due to the road blockade, the police had diverted the traffic via alternate routes.
In Hubballi, members of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, Hasiru Kranti Trust, various trade unions, former MLA N.H. Konaraddi, Congress leaders Rajashekhar Menasinakai, Babajan Mudhol, Bangaresh Hiremath and others including Siddu Teji and B.A. Mudhol staged a symbolic protest at Kittur Chennamma Circle opposing the amendments to Land Reforms Act, APMC Act and others. Later a group proceeded to Hubballi-Dharwad Bypass Road and blocked the road for several minutes.
In Haveri, farmers congregated at Hosamani Siddappa Circle and staged protest under the aegis of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene and blocked the road for around half-an-hour. They urged the government to immediately withdraw the amendments, which they said were detrimental to the farming community.
In Gadag, the protest went on for over an hour with the farmers staging demonstration at Tipu Sultan Circle and blocking the main road. However, as the police had diverted the traffic through alternative routes, long distance travellers were not affected and there was no pile up of vehicles. Farmers’ organisations staged demonstrations and road blocks at all the taluk headquarters in the district condemning the State government’s decision on bringing amendments to various laws. Terming them anti-farmer, they demanded immediate withdrawal of the amendments. Similar protests were reported from various places in Davangere and Uttar Kannada districts."
